According to \nVECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but \nthe paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of \nerror.  For the purpose of comparison, the paper cited the results \nof an unidentified poll made in May 1993. The approval/disapproval \nratings, in percent, for ten Macedonian politicians were: \n\n                                           November 1993    May 1993 \n\nKiro Gligorov, President of the Republic      76/15           78/13 \n\nVasil Tupurkovski, former Macedonian          50/36           43/37 \n   official in Federal Yugoslavia \n\nLjubomir Frckovski, Interior Minister         50/42           42/43 \n\nStojan Andov, Parliamentary Chairman          48/41           48/39 \n\nBranko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister            46/41           44/38 \n\nVlado Popovski, Defense Minister              41/41           36/37 \n\nStevo Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister           40/43   No Data Given \n\nPetar Gosev, Democratic Party leader          34/53           40/42 \n\nTodor Petrov, Independent parliamentarian     32/53   No Data Given \n\nNikola Popovski, Social Democratic            29/46           32/42 \n   Party parliamentarian \n\n   VECER noted that President Gligorov's very high approval rating \nof 90 percent among those over age 65 fell off to a still high 70 \npercent among respondents between 18 and 24.  Residents of Skopje \nranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the \nranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski, \nAndov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola \nPopovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski. \n\n   The results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency \nfor Public Opinion Research and published \"exclusively\" by the \nSkopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov's substantial lead \nin popularity among political figures.  According to the 31 December \n1993 issue of PULS (pages 16-18), the agency gathered the data by \nmeans of telephone interviews with 300 residents in the Republic of \nMacedonia during 20-24 December. PULS also provided data from \nsurveys made in March, June, and September for comparison.  Some of \nthe following percentages are approximate values that were derived \nfrom the graph published by the paper: \n\n                         March       June      September    December \n\nKiro Gligorov             87          82.33      89.33           89 \nStevo Crvenkovski         54          65         49              63 \nStojan Andov              61          62         60              61 \nBranko Crvenkovski        56          60         54 \n53.5 \nLjubomir Frckovski        35          45         48              50 \nPetar Gosev               50          31         52 \n49.53 \nJovan Andonov, \n Deputy Prime Minister    39          39         50              37 \nVlado Popovski            18          25         36              35 \nKiro Popovski, Deputy \n Chairman, Parliament     26          27         33              32 \nAnte Popovski, leader of \n MAAK (Movement for All- \n Macedonian Action)       29          32         32 \nindistinct \nJane Miljovski, Minister \n without Portfolio        --          23         31              24 \nVladimir Golubovski \n VMRO-DP (Internal \n Macedonian Revolutionary \n Organization-Democratic \n Party) leader            --          30         25              23 \nNevzat Halili \n Party for Democratic \n Prosperity official      38.33       38         18              18 \n\nLj upco Georgievski \nVMRO-DPMNE (Internal \nMacedonian Revolutionary \nOrganization-Democratic \nParty for Macedonian \nNational Unity) \nofficial                  18          10         16              17 \nDosta Dimovska \nVMRO-DPMNE \nofficial                  --          11         17              16 \n\n   On pages 6 and 7 of its 15-16 January issue, VECER also published \nthe results of a November 1993 survey on party preferences. \n\"BriMa,\" working with the Gallup organization, interviewed 1,036 \npeople. \n\n   Question: \"If elections were held today, for which party would \nyou vote?\" (all numbers are percentages) \n\nSDSM (Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia)  22.8 \nVMRO-DPMNE                                      11.2 \nDemocratic Party (DP, led by Petar Gosev)        6.3 \nSocialist Party                                  3.3 \nLiberal Party (LP)                               3.2 \nWorkers Party                                    2.9 \nPCERM (Party for the Full Emancipation of \n    Romanies in Macedonia)                       1.8 \nDemocratic Party of Turks in Macedonia           0.8 \nMAAK                                             0.3 \nAnother party                                    4.0 \nUndecided                                       18.6 \nWould not vote                                   6.6 \n\n   VECER noted that some parties fared better in certain cities than \ntheir overall scores indicate.  For example, the DP was about twice \nas popular in Skopje as elsewhere, getting 12.1 percent in the \ncapital; the VMRO-DPMNE was more popular in Bitola, getting 15.7 \npercent, than in the remainder of the country; and the LP in the \nBregalnica area got the support of 10.6 percent, substantially \nhigher than the 3.2 percent support it received overall. \n\n   Question: \"Do you have confidence in the following parties?\" (all \nnumbers are percentages) \n\n              Yes           No       Do Not Know \n\nSDSM           28           51          21 \nVMRO-DPMNE     15           72          14 \nLP             19           59          22 \nPDP-NDP*       20           73           7 \n\n*Party for Democratic Prosperity-People's Democratic Party \n\n   The poll clearly indicated that Macedonians have little \nconfidence in any of the parties currently active in the country. \nRespondents were also asked whether it would be good for the country \nto have elections sooner than scheduled; 62 percent agreed, 20 \npercent disagreed, and 18 percent did not know. These findings were \ncorrelated with party preferences, producing the following results: \nOf those who would vote for the SDSM, 54 percent wanted elections \nsoon, while 34 percent were against early elections. However, 80 \npercent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters favored elections soon, as did 79 \npercent of LP supporters and 71 percent of DP supporters. While 80 \npercent of those surveyed thought that a person should vote (14 \npercent did not agree), only 40 percent thought that it was very \nimportant which party won the elections and 27 percent thought it \nwas somewhat significant. \n\n   (AUTHOR:  GALYEAN.

It provides key information about the media \nof Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia, Slovenia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(incorporating Serbia and Montenegro).  Wherever possible, an \nat tempt has been made to identify affiliations or reliably \nreported connections between media sources and governmental or \ncommunal leadership groups. \n\n   All media identified in this guide are monitored by FBIS, but \nin some cases, due to wartime conditions, receipts have been \nirregular and the information provided in the guide may be \nincomplete.  Characterizations, where provided, are based on FBIS \nanalysis of editorial content.  Entries are grouped by region, \nand, within regions, by category: publications, radio, \ntelevision, and news agencies.  The \"sourcelines\" cited at the \nbeginning of each entry are the descriptors used by FBIS to \nidentify media sources of FBIS translations.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                                 Pyongyang's response to the latest South Korean proposal for \nresumption of inter-Korean talks seems to reflect an effort by \nthe North Korean regime to score polemical points against the \nSouth and its ongoing preference for negotiating with Washington \nover Seoul on the nuclear issue. \n\n                            END SUMMARY \n\n   Apparently violating a recent DPRK-U.S. agreement, Pyongyang \ncountered Seoul's proposal for a 1 March working-level contact \nwith a later date, a counterproposal that seemed aimed mainly at \ngaining some perceived polemical advantage over Seoul.  According \nto Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief \ndelegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone \nmessage to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3 \nMarch.  Pyongyang's attempt to delay the North-South meeting for \ntwo days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached \nwith Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks.  The \n25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28 \nFebruary, specified 1 March as the date the following will take \nplace \"simultaneously\": \n\n   + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year's \nrunning of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent \nto Seoul's decision. \n\n   + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear \ninspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards. \n\n   + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss \nexchanging of special presidential envoys. \n\n   + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level \nbilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva. \n\n   Pyongyang's Motives In proposing a later date for North-South \ncontacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about \nappearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear \ninspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but \nWashington on the nuclear issue.  In the latest attempt to \nportray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper \nNodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President \nKim Yong-sam for allegedly acting \"as if he receives U.S. reports \non DPRK-U.S. talks\" and \"as if he controls the talks\" (Pyongyang \nradio, 28 February).  Kim creates this impression, the commentary \nadded, even though \"he is not even qualified to join the talks.\" \n\n   Pyongyang's reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance \nwas also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North \nKorea expressed in commenting on Kim's 25 February press \nconference commemorating the first year of his presidency. \nDeparting from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal \nattacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean \ndialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped \nabuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a \"traitor,\" a \n\"puppet,\" and a \"political mountebank,\" accusing him of \"arch \ncrimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression,\" and \npromoting national \"division and confrontation,\" and  of plain \n\"stupidity.\"  KCNA went on to claim that Kim's remarks about the \nprobable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal \nfor an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that \nhis \"criminal\" policy \"against the North\" had been wrong.  The \nparty paper Nodong Sinmun on 28 February similarly ridiculed \nKim's \"preposterously absurd remarks\" (Pyongyang radio). \n\n   DPRK-U.S. Talks In sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet \nwith Seoul, Pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming \ntalks with Washington.  Although monitored Pyongyang media have \nnot commented on the news of the upcoming high-level bilateral \ntalks, Ambassador Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's mission \nto the United Nations, was depicted in South Korean media as \nbeing optimistic about the eventual outcome of the negotiations. \nIn an interview with the Seoul daily Hangyore Sinmun (28 \nFebruary), Ho termed it \"fortunate\" that Washington, \"although \nbelatedly,\" withdrew \"unjustified preconditions\" to resumption of \nthe high-level talks, thus paving way for \"a package solution\" of \n\"not only the nuclear issue, but also other issues now standing \nin the way of diplomatic normalization. \n\n   Implications Pyongyang's contrasting media treatment of \nWashington and Seoul indicates that the North Korean leadership \ncontinues to prefer the United States as partner for nuclear \nnegotiations and is inclined to limit talks with the South to the \nminimum required to fulfill preconditions to resumption of high- \nlevel talks with Washington. \n\n(AUTHOR:  YIM.

        "text": "\n\nThe     following summaries highlight information from articles that \nappeared in the Algiers French- and regional Arabic-language press \nin January and February. \n\n   Liamine Zeroual's Image Favorable \n\n   A report in the Arabic-language Doha (Qatar) daily AL-SHARQ of 3 \nFebruary states that the public views newly elected President \nLiamine Zeroual as a very shrewd and experienced military man who \ncan return Algeria \"to the days of Boumedienne.\"  According to the \nreport,  Zeroual is seen as the man who can end the confrontation \nbetween the Islamists and the nationalists since he effectively \npushed for dialogue and reconciliation when he was defense minister. \nZeroual reportedly considers nationalism inseparable from Islam as \npart of his new national order:  \"Zeroual goes back to the origins \nof the Algerian revolution when nationalism embraced Islam during \nthe battle for independence.  In the sixties the two diverged. \nNationalism embraced socialism and Islam was marginalized.  When \nsocialism failed, Islam came back forcefully.\"  Zeroual has \nreportedly created a positive image through his efforts as defense \nminister to deal in a positive manner with both the (Islamic \nSalvation Front) FIS and the regime.  As a result, FIS leader Rabah \nKebir says his party anticipates that Zeroual will change policy, \nbut not necessarily replace government officials.  According to the \nreport, Kebir's statement indicates that the FIS is becoming more \nflexible and wants to undertake serious dialogue with authorities, \nparticularly in light of the communications that took place before \nand after the National Dialogue in January. \n\n   Influx of Refugees in the South Provokes Concern \n\n   French-language Algiers daily EL WATAN of 10 and 23 January has \nreported that Algerian Tuareg frustration and anger is growing in \nTamanrasset because of the high number of illegal foreigners (mainly \nfrom Niger, Mali, and Ghana) who reportedly outnumber Algerians in \nthe region.  The Tuaregs hold these foreigners responsible for \nincreasing crime rates, attacks against tourists, and drug \ntrafficking which weakens the economy and creates a security problem \nin the region.  Hadj Moussa Akhmokh, a prominent Tuareg authority, \nsays a 1992 plan to improve regional security was unsuccessful and \nthat \"the situation has become worse.\"  In December, for example, \nthe two national firms National Company for Mining Research \n(SONAREM) and Center for Energy Research (CREM) were looted and \nseveral vehicles were stolen. In addition, customs officials from \nTamanrasset were kidnapped by a group of individuals armed with \nKalashnikovs, robbed, and taken to Niger where they were manhandled \nbefore being released. According to Hadj Akhamokh, the more recent \nkidnapping of 18 Tuaregs (10 Algerians and eight Malians) set a \n\"serious\" precedent and was the \n\"last straw.\" Citizens planned a peaceful march to demonstrate their \nanger and to attract the attention of authorities until Hadj \nAkhamokh convinced them to postpone the march.  Hadj Akhmokh stated \nthe Tuaregs have responded to his appeal, but that they are \n\"impatient,\" and are waiting for the government to take control of \nthe situation. \n\n   According to Hadj Akhamokh, smuggling is also a serious problem. \nHe faults local police for participating in the corruption and \nallowing it to continue.  Food shipments intended for the local \npopulation are being purchased and resold for twice the price across \nthe border, including milk which has been unavailable in the markets \nfor \"months.\"  According to Hadj Akhmokh, \"smuggling has grown to \nproportions that the Tuaregs can no longer tolerate. To starve the \npeople is to push us to revolt.\" (See FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE FB PN \n93-151 \"Regional Census Prompted by Security, Economic Concerns,\" 8 \nApril 1993, and NEAR EAST SOUTH ASIA REPORT 93AFO622B \"Illegal \nImmigrants in South; Census Unreported,\" 12 May 1993 p 11 for \nadditional reporting on this subject.) \n\n   'Terrorists' Exert Pressure; Press, Lifestyle Threatened \n\n   EL WATAN of 16 January reported that \"terrorist threats\" have \npromoted a climate of fear in the town of Meftah, \"imposing a life \nstyle that has nothing to do with Algerian society.\"  According to \nthe report, Meftah and Medea have become towns which immerse \nthemselves more and more in Islamic, even \"fundamentalist,\" \ntendencies.  For example, the article stated that tracts posted \nthroughout Meftah threaten that women who do not wear the hijab and \nwho wear Western style clothes will \"have to deal with us.\"  In \naddition threats have been made against beauty salons, Moorish \nbaths, and cassette vendors.  \"Fundamentalists\" have also attacked \nthe press, declaring it \"unsuitable reading.\"  EL WATAN reported in \nthree articles from 16 to 18 January that newspaper vendors and \nbookstores in Blida, Medea, ChIef, and El Khemis were no longer \nselling newspapers.  According to EL WATAN of 16 January, national \npublications, particularly those of the independent press, have \nsuddenly disappeared from the shelves due to \"terrorist threats.\" \nOne citizen reported, \"Don't use my name, but I am afraid to tell \nyou that tobacco shops and bookstores are scared to death. They are \nconvinced that if they continue to sell newspapers there could be \nserious reprisals.\"  EL WATAN of 17 and 18 January reported that \nvendors have denied the threats, blaming distributors for failing to \ndeliver the newspapers.  Nonetheless, security services have ordered \nmerchants to sell newspapers or be shut down. \n\n   Citizens Reportedly Buying Visas \n\n   An article in the French-language daily ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 19 \nJanuary recounted the frustrations of dozens of Algerians trying to \nobtain French visas.  Given the evening curfew, many spend the night \nin nearby hotels or in the elevators or hallways of neighboring \nbuildings.  According to the report, lines can begin as early as 4 \na.m., causing citizens to resort to purchasing a place in line for \n500-1000 dirhams, depending on the position in line and the time it \nis purchased.  In the words of one citizen, \"It is a real stock \nexchange.\"  The French consulate reportedly closed for two days and \nsuspended issuing visas in an effort to set up a new system whereby \nvisa requests would be handled through the mail. \n\n   (QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, AFRICA/LEVANT \nBRANCH AT (703)  733-6408) \nENEAG/01 Mar/POLCHF/ECONF/TOTF/NEASA Division/jf 1/2129Z MAR \n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                                Russian officials have tried to minimize the impact on U.S.- \nRussian relations of the arrest of Aldrich Ames and his wife on \ncharges of spying for the USSR and Russia against the United \nStates.  Joined by Russian media commentators, they have \ncriticized the involvement of high-level U.S. officials in \npublicizing the case, saying that the case involves normal \nespionage activity that all countries pursue.  In addition, \nRussian media across the political spectrum have viewed U.S. \nhandling of the incident as evidence of a U.S. desire to \nmarginalize Russia's international role. \n\n                            END SUMMARY \n\n   In their initial public statements on the Ames case, Russian \nofficials have consistently tried to minimize the incident's \nimpact on U.S.-Russian relations.  They have decried the \npublicity given to the case by high-level U.S. officials, saying \nthat incidents such as the Ames case should be handled by \nintelligence agencies without involving officials at higher \nlevels: \n\n   -- According to ITAR-TASS on 24 February, Foreign Minister Andrey \nKozyrev said that it would be better to let the intelligence \nservices handle the case and \"not to politicize or ideologize the \nsituation.\"  He emphasized that it is important for the United \nStates and Russia to continue to \"cooperate and not to attach \nundue, hypertrophied significance to this case.\"  After the \nRussians expelled a U.S. Embassy officer in retaliation for the \nU.S. expulsion of a Russian Embassy official in Washington, \nKozyrev reiterated these views and claimed Moscow \"had to resort\" \nto a reciprocal expulsion but this process of \"reciprocity\" \nshould be eliminated, \"the sooner the better\" (ITAR-TASS, 28 \nFebruary). \n\n   -- A 25 February Foreign Ministry press statement sniped at U.S. \nhandling of the case, criticizing \"attempts by the special \nservices to drag the political leadership into their mutual \nrelations,\" and noted that there are \"appropriate channels\" that \ncan be \"brought fully\" into use to deal with such cases.  The \nstatement said that if, as reported, the investigation of Ames \nhad begun ten months ago, \"this was sufficient time for us to be \ncontacted directly\" and for U.S. officials to \"share their \nanxieties with us before making them public\" (ITAR-TASS, 25 \nFebruary). \n\n   -- Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) officials refused \nto comment directly on Ames, but expressed surprise that the \nUnited States made such an outcry over actions FIS officials \ndescribed as common practice for all intelligence services.  FIS \ndirector Yevgeniy Primakov had \"no comment\" on the case (ITAR- \nTASS, 23 February).  FIS press spokesman Yuriy Kobaladze noted \nthat declining to comment on such allegations is the general \npractice among intelligence services and stressed \"there is \nnothing new or sensational here in the fact that countries engage \nin intelligence activities\" (Moscow radio, Russian TV, 23 \nFebruary).  He went on to claim that neither the United States \nnor Russia had \"ever pledged to curtail intelligence activity\" \nand that Washington has \"been very active\" in intelligence \nactivity in Russia and the other newly independent states. \n\n   Breaking ranks, at least temporarily, with other officials, \nMikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General Staff, \nacknowledged Ames' links to Russia but later retracted this \nadmission.  A 26 February ITAR-TASS report quoted Kolesnikov as \nsaying \"Ames worked in the UnitedStates for Russia\" but \nnonetheless claiming that he had \"inflicted no direct damage\" on \nthe United States.  On 28 February, however, Kolesnikov stated \nthat the General Staff and its intelligence service \"have no \ninformation on any links\" between Ames and Soviet or Russian \nintelligence agencies.  According to ITAR-TASS, Kolesnikov went \non to claim that \"U.S. media misinterpreted\" his 26 February \nstatement (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). \n\n   Russian Media \n\n   Russian media across the political spectrum indignantly \ncriticized U.S. handling of the case and speculated, sometimes on \nthe basis of comments by unnamed officials, that the United \nStates had ulterior motives in timing the public exposure of \nAmes.  Some commentators said that U.S. officials had exposed the \ncase now because they wanted to create a pretext to reevaluate \nU.S.-Russian relations in the wake of the recent slowdown of \nreform in Russia, while others alleged that the United States \nwanted to take the gloss off Russia's diplomatic success in \nbrokering a compromise over Sarajevo.  Media commentary, even in \npublications like Izvestiya, a strong supporter of Russian \nefforts to integrate with the West, supported the Russian \ngovernment position and criticized the United States: \n\n   -- A 24 February article in Izvestiya remarked on what it saw as \nthe \"hypocrisy\" of U.S. reaction to the Ames case, since, it \nclaimed, Russia \"has no less right to secret operations in the \nUnited States than America has to espionage in Russia.\"  A 25 \nFebruary article on the case headlined the question \"Why Is \nWashington Making a Fuss?\" and cited \"competent sources\" as \nspeculating that the Ames' arrest was an attempt to put Moscow in \nits \"place\" after Russian diplomacy in Bosnia for the first time \nin recent years \"cast the United States in a secondary role.\" \n\n   -- A 25 February article in the government newspaper Rossiyskaya \nGazeta worried that the Ames case is being given \"political \novertones\" reminiscent of the 1960 U-2 incident, which triggered \na sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations.  The article claimed \nthat \"certain forces\" in the United States were trying to \n\"exaggerate this affair\" because they are unhappy with the new \nChernomyrdin government and with Yeltsin's Bosnia initiative, \nwhich had \"thwarted the hawks' attempt to resolve the Serbian \nquestion through air strikes\" and had \"suddenly and very sharply\" \nincreased Russia's \"political weight in the international arena.\" \nThe article concluded, however, that both the U.S. and Russian \npresidents were demonstrating a \"well-balanced approach\" and \nexpressed hope that political relations between the two countries \nwould not be aggravated. \n\n   -- A 25 February article in the Defense Ministry's newspaper \nKrasnaya Zvezda cited several theories advanced by unnamed \n\"experts\" to explain the U.S. \"ballyhoo\" over the case.  The \narticle claimed U.S. intelligence agencies wished to get even \nafter the exposure of more than 2O foreign intelligence agents, \nincluding U.S. spies, in the last year.  An article on 26 \nFebruary charged that the \"fuss\" over the \"routine event\" of a \ndouble agent's exposure is taking on an \"increasingly hysterical \ncharacter\" in the United States, claiming with obvious sarcasm \nthat \"Langley believes that only [its agents] have the right to \ncarry out intelligence activity.\"  Prominent Krasnaya Zvezda \nobserver Aleksandr Golts, in a commentary published on 1 March, \nimplicitly took issue with this analysis, however, claiming \ninstead that it is Russia's newly demonstrated foreign policy \nindependence that has \"driven Washington berserk.\"  Golts \ncontended that the United States is publicizing the Ames case \nbecause Russia's efforts to \"implement an active foreign policy \ncourse\" with its \"successful initiative in the Balkans\" had put \nthe United States \"on the sidelines\" after it had become \naccustomed to \"feeling that it is the only world leader, the only \nsuperpower.\"  He concluded by advocating the \"vital necessity\" of \na \"partnership\" with the \"rules of conduct. .. the same for \neveryone. \n\n   -- The independent pro-reform newspaper Segodnya, in a 24 \nFebruary article, warned that the Ames case would revive the \"old \noutcry\" that the \"Russians cannot be trusted.\"  The article \nlinked the case to Yeltsin's Bosnia initiative, particularly his \nproposal for a summit on the issue.  Claiming that Yeltsin's \nsummit proposal would be \"inconvenient\" for Western leaders, the \narticle implied that the Ames \"scandal\" had been whipped up to \n\"remove the Russian initiative from the agenda.\"  A 1 March \narticle cited unnamed sources as saying that Russian security \nservices \"are not interested in arousing passions,\" but that \n\"influential U.S. forces\" are hoping to \"impose a time-out\" for \nthe United States to reexamine its policy toward Russia. \n\n   -- In an interview published in the 26 February edition of the \nlabor-oriented newspaper Trud, retired KGB Major General Boris \nSolomatin, citing examples of other spy cases where there was no \nofficial outcry, bitterly ascribed what he called Washington's \n\"inappropriate reaction\" to the Ames affair to U.S. \"imperial \nthinking\" about Russia.  Lamenting that Russia had been \n\"transformed\" from an equal power whose intelligence services \ncould work against those of the United States to one which now \n\"has to ask permission to do so,\" Solomatin complained that the \nU.S. attitude is \"we can, you cannot\" because \"we have the money\" \nand \"you have an outstretched hand.\"  Contending that the United \nStates had not given much thought to the possible consequences \nwhen it \"embarked on this scandal,\" Solomatin claimed that now, \nwhen Russians see that the \"big bucks\" spent on intelligence are \n\"working,\" they will recognize the importance of intelligence and \nbegin to \"organize it properly.\" \n\n   Implications \n\n   The pains taken by Russian officials to play down the Ames affair \nand to minimize its effect on U.S.-Russian relations clearly \nindicate Moscow's desire to keep the relationship on a firm \nfooting.  However, the indignant reaction on the part of both \nofficials and the media to the U.S. handling of the case, as well \nas the sensitivity displayed toward perceived attempts to \nrelegate Russia to a marginal role in diplomacy or intelligence \nactivities, indicates that Moscow will continue to assert itself \nwhen it feels that the United States is trying to take unfair \nadvantage. \n\n(AUTHOR:  BELLINGER.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                        Using his decree power to reorganize the media bureaucracy, \nRussian President Boris Yeltsin has consolidated his control over \nthe broadcast media and attenuated the influence of the other \nbranches of government and the cabinet.  At the same time he has \ntaken the first step in what is likely to be a far reaching, if \nreversible, reduction of the state's role in television by giving \na private television company access to Russia's 4th television \nchannel.  The reorganization appears to signal that longtime \nclose Yeltsin adviser Mikhail Poltoranin, who once shaped \nYeltsin's media policy, no longer enjoys the President's \nconfidence in this area. \n\n                      END SUMMARY \n\n   In a series of edicts dating from 5 December, Yeltsin has \neffected a complete restructuring of state media structures and \nshuffled key media personnel consolidating his authority over \nstate television, expanding private access to television \nbroadcasting, and creating a potentially powerful new media \narbitration court (see box 1). \n\nBegin Box 1 \n\nYeltsin Decrees Changes in Media Structures \n\n   In a series of edicts issued from 5 December to 4 January, \nRussian President Boris Yeltsin reorganized state television, \ncreated a new media oversight body, and made major changes in key \nmedia posts: \n\n--A 5 December edict \"On the Directors of VGTRK [the All-Russian \nState Television and Radio Company--RTV]\" reappointed Oleg \nPoptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko as chairman and general director \nrespectively of RTV (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i Pravitelstva \nRossiyskoy Federatsii, 27 December 1993). \n   --A 22 December edict \"On Improving State Management in the Mass \nInformation Sphere\" abolished the Ministry of the Press and \nInformation and the Federal Information Center (FIC), created the \nRussian Federation Committee for the Press and the Federal \nService of Russia for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and \nappointed Boris Mironov to head the former and Aleksandr Yakovlev \nthe latter (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). \n   --A second 22 December edict \"On Setting Up the 'Efir' Russian \nState Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding Company and \nthe 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting Company\" \nconsolidated state control over the the national television \nbroadcast infrastructure (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). \n   --A third 22 December edict \"On Utilizing Moscow Television's \nEighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination Network\" granted \nan independent television production company, NTV, access to \nRussia's 4th channel (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). \n   --A 29 December edict \"On the Court of Appeals for Information \nDisputes Under the President of the Russian Federation\" which is \nlinked explicitly to articles 29 and 80 of the new constitution \ngranting citizens the right to \"freedom of mass information\" and \nmaking the president the guarantor of that freedom created a new \narbitration body under the president to resolve disputes over \ntelevision coverage and access (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January). \n   --A 4 January edict officially relieved Mikhail Poltoranin of his \nduties as head of the FIC (ITAR-TASS, 4 January). \n\nEnd Box 1 \n\n   President's Role Strengthened \n\n   Several aspects of the reorganization strengthen the president's \npowers over the broadcast media.  The new television and radio \nservice under Yakovlev will be subordinate to the president, \nwhile the edict appointing Poptsov to head RTV extends Yeltsin's \nappointment powers to an area once held by the Supreme Soviet \nPresidium.  The creation of 'Efir' consolidates state control \nover the television broadcast infrastructure under a presidential \nappointee, and the new information appeals court gives the \npresident a potentially great advantage over the other branches \nof government in determining the political slant and content of \ntelevision programming. \n\n   Profile Lowered \n\n   By giving the new press committee and broadcast service sub- \ncabinet rank and moving out Mikhail Poltoranin and Vladimir \nShumeyko, two favorite targets of his opponents, Yeltsin appears \nto be attempting to move the media and media policy away from the \nfront lines of the political struggle.  Poltoranin, as chief of \nthe now defunct Federal Information Center (FIC), and Shumeyko, \nas head of the now abolished Ministry of the Press and \nInformation both held ministerial rank but neither of the heads \nof the new bodies has ministerial rank or cabinet status. \n\n   New Bodies' Powers \n\n   The reorganization gives the new broadcasting service the \npreeminent role in regulating broadcast media, eliminating \noverlapping responsibilities that existed under the former \nstructures.  From the FIC the broadcast service inherits the \nfunctions of \"coordinating\" state policy for television and \nradio, assisting in the provision of \"objective\" information to \ndomestic and international audiences on Russian political and \neconomic issues, and participating in the process of drafting \nlegislation on the broadcast media.  From the Press and \nInformation Ministry the service inherits responsibilities for \nimplementing state television and radio broadcasting policy and \nfor television and radio licensing and registration.  The service \nalso has authority to administer government financing and \nsubsidies for national and regional television (Rossiyskiye \nVesti, 24 December 1993) but its authority has been severely \ncircumscribed by the Ministry of Finance (see box 2).  The 22 \nDecember edict names the Committee on the Press the legal \nsuccessor to both the Ministry of Press and Information and the \nFIC but does not elaborate its functions in detail.  It \npresumably will assume the FIC and press ministry functions that \nrelate specifically to the press.  The edict does explicitly \nestablish that the committee will administer government financing \nand subsidies, formerly a prerogative of the press ministry. \n\nBegin Box 2 \n\n   Finance Ministry Cuts Television Budget \n\n   On 1 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported that acting Finance \nMinister Sergey Dubinin had recently \"notified representatives of \nOstankino and Russian Television . . . of a 50 percent cut in \nfinancing.\"   The decision, if not amended, could have a \ndevastating impact on both the television companies and the \nMinistry of Communications which broadcasts the television \nsignals and depends heavily on state television for its own \nrevenues.  Russian Television General Director Anatoliy Lysenko \npredicted that the funding cuts could force transmitter shutdowns \nand lead to the \"loss of the broadcasting network on a large \nterritory of Russia\" (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 29 January).  It is \nnot clear if the ministry's decision to slash funding is a first \nstep in a policy of reducing state ownership, as Yakovlev and \nothers have advocated, or if state television simply served as a \nconvenient target of opportunity in the finance ministry's \nstruggle to control the money supply. \n\nEnd Box 2 \n\n   Poltoranin Routed \n\n   Aspects of the reorganization strongly suggest that Poltoranin, \nonce the most influential figure in the Yeltsin administration in \nshaping media policy has suffered a startling defeat at the hands \nof his rival for influence Shumeyko.  According to Yuriy Baturin, \nYeltsin's security adviser and a co-drafter of the existing law \non the mass media, Yeltsin, Shumeyko, and Prime Minister Viktor \nChernomyrdin jointly agreed to the terms of the 22 December edict \n\"On Improving State Management in the Mass Information Sphere\" \n(Izvestiya, 29 December 1993).  That edict provided for separate \ncommissions to liquidate the Press Ministry and the FIC but \nappointed Shumeyko to head both.  Poltoranin also appears to have \nlost a battle over the edict granting NTV access to channel 4, a \nmove which he reportedly opposed.  Despite his removal as FIC \nhead, Poltoranin will continue to be involved in media policy- \n-possibly even in opposition to Yeltsin--as head of the Committee \non Information Policy and Communications in the State Duma (ITAR- \nTASS; Rossiyskiye Vesti, 19 January).  But, for the first time \nsince before Yeltsin was elected president, (See Note 1) \nPoltoranin will not have the authority to directly influence the \nadministration's media policy or to advise the president in an \nofficial capacity. \n(Note 1) With the exception of a brief hiatus from 25 November \n1992 when he stepped down as Minister of the Press and \nInformation to 25 December 1992 when he was appointed head of the \nnewly created Federal Information Center.  Poltoranin was \nappointed Minister of the Press and Information 10 July 1990 by \nthe RSFSR Supreme Soviet. \n\n   Yakovlev's Vision for Television \n\n   Yeltsin's appointment of \"the father of glasnost\" and former \nclose Gorbachev adviser Aleksandr Yakovlev to head the new \nbroadcasting service sends ambiguous signals about his intentions \nregarding the broadcast media.  Yakovlev once served as the head \nof the CPSU Central Committee's propaganda department and yet has \nbeen credited as the architect of the glasnost strategy to \nliberalize the Soviet media.  Although he has a reputation as a \nreformer he does not appear to advocate westernization of Russia \nor unrestricted freedom for the media.  In an Izvestiya interview \n(24 December) following his appointment, Yakovlev stated that he \nwould refrain from \"influencing\" subject matter but rather play a \n\"strategic\" role as Ostankino chairman.  At the same time, \nhowever, he expressed hope that the company will be able to \nfulfill its role in society \"without succumbing to extremes\" and \non another occasion he spoke of increasing \"the share of Russian \nprograms\" as a \"counterweight\" to foreign productions, and \ncriticized excessive sex and violence--generally attributed to \nforeign influence--on television (RRIA, 2 February).  He has also \napparently agreed recently to introduce a new weekly program on \nOstankino in which Head of the Presidential Administration Sergey \nFilatov will \"explain\" presidential edicts (Mayak Radio, 31 \nJanuary). \n   Yakovlev's appointment may signal future reductions in the \nstate's role in television.  He has asserted that there \"must be \none state television company\" which would operate without paid \nadvertising instead of the four companies (See Note 2) that exist \nnow (RIA, 2 February).  This goal appears to go hand-in-hand with \nthe recent decision of the finance ministry to cut funding (see \nbox 2) and may indeed become the ultimate solution to the state's \ndifficulty financing state television at current levels. \nRealization of Yakovlev's goal of having one non-commercial state \ntelevision company could also provide a financial shot in the arm \nto non-state television since it would become the only vehicle \nfor television advertising. \n(Note 2) The four are Ostankino, RTV, Channel 4, and the St. \nPetersburg Channel. \n\n   Yakovlev's Deputy \n\n   Valentin Lazutkin, a longtime television professional who appears \nto share Yakovlev's views on reducing the state's role in \ntelevision has been appointed as Yakovlev's deputy.  With \nYakovlev taking a \"strategic\" approach to his chairmanship, \nLazutkin, who has spent nearly 30 years in television, and served \nas first deputy chairman at Ostankino until his recent promotion \nwill presumably run day-to-day operations at Ostankino.  Asked in \na recent interview published in Izvestiya, (21 January) about his \nopinion on the recent change in leadership, he expressed the \n\"hope\" that \"we need not fear that Ostankino's airspace will be \nturned into the political property of a particular party, which \nhappened under the former chairman.\"  He also noted that he was \n\"untroubled\" by the recent decision to grant the private \nproduction company NTV access to the fourth channel (discussed \nbelow), though he did criticize the fact that access to the \nchannel was not granted on a \"competitive\" basis.  And finally, \ndiscussing his concept of the future of state-run television, \nLazutkin said there \"should be one powerful Russian company which \nis . . . part of the state structure\" and he advocated \ntransforming Ostankino into a company aimed at foreign audiences \n(including Russian-speaking viewers in the CIS). \n\n   NTV Gains Broadcast Access \n\n   In what may be the first step towards realizing Yakovlev's vision \nof decreasing the number of state television companies, Yeltsin \ngranted television broadcasting rights on channel 4 to an \nindependent company, NTV.  The 22 December edict \"On Using Moscow \nTelevision's Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination \nNetwork\" states that NTV will receive 58 hours of weekly \nbroadcast time as an \"experiment\" aimed at \"developing non-state \ntelevision.\"  NTV has been broadcasting a nightly news program, \nSegodnya, and a weekly newsmagazine, RItogi, to viewers of the St. \nPetersburg channel, which has a potential audience of about 70 \nmillion viewers, and will continue to do so.  The significance of \nthe edict for NTV does not appear to be that it increases \npotential audience size since the two channels have significant \naudience overlap but that it secures a measure of independence \nfrom St. Petersburg Television. \n   Most importantly the NTV edict affirms Yeltsin's support for the \nidea of independent television following an apparent tug-of-war \nwithin the administration.  Yeltsin first issued the edict on 22 \nNovember but suspended it the next day (ITAR-TASS, 22 November \n1993; 23 November 1993).  On 22 December Yeltsin reissued the \nedict in almost identical form except that the new version tasked \nthe government with reviewing the issue of \"state participation\" \nin the ranks of the founders, making this text even more \nprivatization-oriented than the original. \n\n   Control of TV Infrastructure \n\n   In the reorganization, Yeltsin reaffirmed that the state will \nretain its monopoly of the broadcast infrastructure, at least for \nthe present.  The edict of 22 December \"On Setting Up the 'Efir' \nRussian State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding \nCompany and the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting \nCompany\" created the Efir holding company, whose assets include \nmuch of the state's broadcasting infrastructure.  Efir will be \npartially privatized, with employees receiving some shares, but \nthe edict stipulates that the state will retain ownership of a \ncontrolling interest for three years.  The edict does not \nspecify, however, what the state will do with its controlling \ninterest after three years.  The edict appointed Lazutkin to \nserve as chairman of Efir's board of directors.  Baturin \ncriticized the creation of Efir (and the reorganization in \ngeneral) which he claims \"increases the state's control over the \nmass media\" and even \"to a certain extent threatens freedom of \nthe press\" (RIzvestiya, 29 December 1993).  Noting that \"all \ncentral television channels are broadcast\" through Efir, Baturin \nasserted that independent television companies will \"remain non- \nstate only in formal terms.\" \n\n   Control over RTV \n\n   The reorganization also serves notice that the other major \nnational television company, RTV, will remain under Yeltsin's and \nYakovlev's control.  Control of the company had been a prolonged \npoint of contention between the President and the former Supreme \nSoviet.  In a demonstration of his authority over RTV, Yeltsin \nre-appointed the current chairman and general director, Oleg \nPoptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko, by the edict of 5 December. \nFormerly, according to Russian Television's Statute, the right of \nappointment to these posts was held by the Supreme Soviet \nPresidium (Sobrianiye Aktov Pravitelsta RSFSR, No 6, 1991). \n\n   Poltoranin Admirer To Head Press Body \n\n   The 22 December edict reorganizing the media structures appointed \nBoris Mironov, former head of the Rossiya Publishing House and \napparent close friend and admirer of Poltoranin as chairman of \nthe new Committee on the Press.  According to a profile of \nMironov from Obshchaya Gazeta, Mironov had previously worked for \nKomsomolskaya Pravda and with Poltoranin when the latter served \nat Pravda.  Mironov reportedly also served for \"several days\" as \nchief editor of Rossiyskaya Gazeta but was removed prior to or \nshortly after publication of the paper's inaugural issue in \nNovember 1990 (Obshchaya Gazeta, 14-20 January; Rossiyskaya \nGazeta, 6 November 1993).  According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta's \ncurrent chief editor, Natalya Polezhayeva, Mironov was removed \n\"on the personal orders\" of then Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman \nRuslan Khasbulatov. \n\n   New Media Watchdog Created \n\n   Yeltsin's establishment of the Court of Appeals for Information \nDisputes under the president appears to be an attempt to preempt \nthe new parliament from \"interfering\" in media policy as did its \npredecessor (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January).  The court is a \nsuccessor to the Information Arbitration Court that was created \nduring the recent parliamentary election campaign to ensure fair \nmedia coverage with largely the same membership, including \nchairman Anatoliy Vengerov.  During the campaign, Vengerov and \nthe court demonstrated a degree of independence from Yeltsin by \nruling that campaigning against the draft constitution was \npermissible, explicitly opposing Yeltsin's stated position that \nsought to prohibit such campaigning (ITAR-TASS, 1 December 1993; \nIzvestiya, 27 November 1993).  The court's powers include the \nauthority to resolve disputes over the distribution of airtime \namong parliamentary factions.  It is also charged with ensuring \n\"objectivity and authenticity\" in news reporting and the \n\"principle of pluralism\" in radio and television programming, and \nmay issue warnings regarding potential violations of the media \nlaw, a power it inherited from the defunct Ministry of the Press \nand Information.  Despite the court's record of independent \naction, the edict makes it dependent on the president stipulating \nthat it \"is not part of the system\" of Russian Federation federal \ncourts, and the new body's statute gives the president the power \nto appoint and fire its members (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February). \n\n   Prospects \n\n   Yeltsin has crafted a reorganization of Russian media structures \nthat seems simultaneously to open the door to relinquishing \ndirect control over increasing amounts of broadcast airtime while \nmaintaining presidential control over the main facilities of \nstate television and the process of media oversight.  The new \nparliament may challenge Yeltsin for control of at least some \nmedia--there is already talk among deputies of reasserting \ncontrol over Rossiyskaya Gazeta which the dissolved Supreme \nSoviet controlled (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 5 January).  Yeltsin is \nlikely to strongly resist such attempts and may invoke his \nenhanced constitutional authority to do so.  He may also \ncalculate that more western-style media independence is the best \nway of ensuring that the media keeps supporting reform and stays \nout of his opponents' grasp.  At the same time economic reality \nas manifest by the recent one-day widespread broadcast blackout \nand the Finance Ministry's decision to cut television funding by \n50 percent will likely encourage him to move towards granting \nmore and more air time to independent television companies as he \nhas done with NTV and channel 4. \n(AUTHOR:  CRIMMINS.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                           Syrian media reacted to the massacre in Hebron by intensifying \ncriticism of the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP) and \nthe PLO itself and reviving more hostile anti-Israel rhetoric \nreminiscent of the years preceding the current peace \nnegotiations.  At the same time, despite the Arab suspension of \nbilateral peace talks with Israel and the use of Syrian media to \nquestion the benefits of resuming them without further Israeli \nconcessions, Damascus has taken pains to signal its commitment to \nthe overall peace process. \n\n                        END SUMMARY \n\n   Syria's closely controlled media have portrayed the 25 February \nmassacre as a direct product of the DOP, implying that the event \nserves to vindicate Syria's opposition to the agreement.  In this \ncontext, the media have stepped up criticism of the PLO \nleadership for signing both the DOP and a subsequent document on \nits implementation, which was concluded in Cairo on 9 February. \nA Damascus radio commentary declared that the \"massacre must be \ndirectly or indirectly laid at the door of the Oslo and Cairo \nagreements and whatever other pact may follow.\"  It criticized \n\"Palestinian negotiators\" for having \"forgotten Israel's crime- \nridden track record\" and being \"too trustful and unsuspecting, \nthereby facilitating\" the killings in Hebron (26 February).  As \nreported by Damascus radio the following day, an editorial in the \ndaily Al-Ba'th called the massacre \"the end result\" of \"the \nflawed and lame agreement\" concluded between Israel and \"the \nPalestinian negotiators.\" \n   Moreover, in a revival of the volume and virulence of media \ncriticism of the PLO that followed the signing of the DOP in \nSeptember, Syrian media have given substantial coverage in the \nwake of the massacre to anti-PLO statements by hardline Damascus- \nbased Palestinian groups.  For example: \n   --The official news agency SANA quoted Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine-General Command leader Ahmad Jibril as \nimplicitly threatening the lives of 'Arafat and other mainstream \nPLO leaders (See Note 1).  Calling the massacre a \"fruit of the \nGaza-Jericho agreement,\" Jibril declared that \"the determination \nof our Palestinian Arab people and Arab and Islamic nation will \npunish those who conceded our sanctities, territories, and \nhistory\" (27 February). \n   (Note 1) Jibril's threatening statement echoed his declaration on \n30 September that \"'Arafat's fate will be no better than that of \nFrench General Petain during World War II\" (Damascus radio). \n   --Damascus radio, reporting on a \"mammoth popular demonstration\" \nin the Palestinian camp al-Yarmuk organized by the hardline \nfactions, quoted Islamic Jihad Movement Secretary General Fathi \nal-Shaqaqi as calling the massacre \"a continuation of the \nliquidation plot embodied in the Gaza-Jericho accord\" (28 \nFebruary). \n\n   Anti-Israel Vitriol \n\n   Syrian media have also reverted to the kind of virulent anti- \nIsrael rhetoric that was a staple of Syrian commentary in the \npast but had been used with less regularity at least since the \nstart of the current peace process in October 1991.  Thus, \ncommentaries in the wake of the massacre have very frequently \nfavored the term \"Zionists\" and \"Tel Aviv rulers\" over \"Israel\" \nand \"the Israeli government.\"  Claiming that the Hebron bloodbath \nwas simply the most recent of a long series of Israeli massacres- \n-alleged to have included the 27 February church bombing in \nLebanon (for example, Damascus radio, 27 February)--the \ncommentaries have declared bluntly that the killings are \nconsistent with the nature of Zionism and demonstrate the \nimpossibility of Arab-Israeli \"coexistence.\"  Several \ncommentaries in the daily Tishrin, as reported in same-day \nbroadcasts by Damascus radio, followed in this vein: \n   --On 26 February an editorial claimed that the Hebron massacre \n\"proves the impossibility of coexistence between Arabs and \nIsraelis resulting from the fascist Zionist rancor against the \nArabs.\" \n   --An editorial the following day declared that, through the \nrecent massacre, \"Zionism is addressing a message that it has not \nchanged . . . its racist and aggressive colors.\" \n   --An editorial on the 28th claimed that \"Zionism and racism . \nthrive on rivers of blood\" and referred to Israel as \"this racist \nNazi Zionist ghoul.\" \n\n   Commitment to Peace Process, But ... \n\n   Nevertheless, Damascus has taken pains to emphasize commitment to \nthe peace process, while using the media to question the utility \nof resuming the now-suspended talks in the absence of significant \nconcessions by Israel--a tack it has taken during previous \ndisruptions in the negotiations.  The Damascus radio announcement \nof the suspension of bilateral peace talks in Washington by \nSyria, Lebanon, and Jordan was quick to cite a Syrian spokesman \nas having \"confirmed statements by U.S. officials that this step \ndoes not mean an end to the whole peace process that began two \nyears ago\" (28 February). \n   Two subsequent media commentaries that referred to the suspension \nof talks also took pains to convey that the suspension is \ntemporary and to stress that Syria remains committed to the peace \nprocess.  Damascus radio, affirming that \"the Arabs are advocates \nof true peace,\" declared that \"the suspension of talks will not \nharm the peace talks, especially since only a few days are left \nbefore the conclusion\" of the current session (1 March).  And the \ndaily Al-Ba'th on the same day followed up mention of the \nsuspension of talks by adding that the Arabs are not \"terminating \nthe peace efforts\" but are \"in effect telling the sponsors of the \npeace process to wake up to their responsibilities\" (Damascus \nradio). \n   At the same time, some editorial commentary has cast doubt on the \nusefulness of negotiations under current conditions and called on \nWashington to play a more vigorous role in pressing Israel for \nconcessions (See Note 2).  For example, Damascus radio declared \nthat \"talking about peace in light of the serious Zionist \nescalation and Israel's continued refusal to withdraw from the \noccupied territories or halt settlement activities is a waste of \ntime,\" adding that \"it is, indeed, absurd.\"  The commentary \nconcluded that \"there is no purpose or meaning in holding any \npeace talks that are not based on a clear Israeli commitment to \nimplement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from \nthe occupied Arab territories\" (28 February).  As reported by the \nradio, a subsequent editorial in Al-Thawrah asserted that \n\"salvaging the peace process and the stalled peace talks requires \nthe application of all sorts of pressures on Israel to make it \nhonor the relevant international legitimacy resolutions and \nconventions, respect human rights, dismantle settlements, disarm \nsettlers, and return to the Arabs all their territories and \nrights\" (2 March). \n   (Note 2) Such expressions of doubt, and even the conditioning of \nresuming the talks on Israeli concessions, have appeared \nperiodically in Syrian media commentary since the beginning of \nthe peace process.  For example, an editorial in Tishrin last \nNovember declared that \"any resumption of the peace talks\"--which \nhad not then convened since before the signing of the DOP--must \nbe preceded by a clear and public Israeli commitment to the peace \nprocess and its principles, especially full withdrawal from the \nArab territories\" (Damascus radio, 20 November 1993).  Several \nweeks later, however, Damascus announced its intention to return \nto the peace talks, without any public commitment from Israel on \nthe issue of withdrawal (Damascus radio, 9 December 1993). \n\n   Implications \n\n   Although Damascus is probably hoping that the attack will scuttle \nthe DOP, Syrian media's anti-PLO attacks and shrill, hostile \nrhetoric on Israel will likely subside, though not disappear, if \npeace negotiations are brought back on track.  Moreover, in \nraising claims that coexistence is impossible, Syrian media took \ncare to rule out coexistence not between Israel and the Arab \nstates but between \"Israelis and Arabs\" --presumably in the \noccupied territories.  By such behavior, Syria has ensured that \nthe door remains open to the eventual resumption of the peace \ntalks. \n(AUTHOR: BROWN.

The newspaper's two-part investigative \nreport on this subject published on 23 and 24 January included \ncomments from Egyptian health officials and meat industry \nrepresentatives.  According to AL-WAFD, this \"spoiled\" meat is said \nto frequently exceed international standards fdr fat content and is \navailable at extremely low cost to local importers, and, \nconsequently \"the meat is sold at from LE 7 to LE 10 whereas the \nimport cost is only LE 1.\"  Due to the profit margin available from \nsales to Egypt, European distributors and Egyptian middlemen are \nreportedly mounting a campaign against the Egyptian Government \"to \npressure the Egyptian government into raising the fat content of \nimported meat from 2O percent to 35 percent; in other words, for \nevery 1000 kgs of meat, the fat content is 350 kgs.\"  AL-WAFD \ncontinues, \"This pressure by distributors extends even to EC \nofficials, to the point that one official has threatened to halt \nmeat shipments to Egypt.\"  In an effort to circumvent government \ncontrols, importers reportedly further conceal the fat content of \nforeign meat imports by selling the meat piecemeal, thereby \ninvalidating import certificates. \n\n   Egyptian health experts interviewed by AL-WAFD expressed concern \nabout the illnesses that can result from the consumption of such \nmeats, ranging from heart disease to salmonella.  They said that the \navailability of this meat will have a direct impact on the public's \nhealth. Of particular concern is the plethora of factories producing \ninexpensive luncheon meats primarily from frozen imported meat. \nHealth officials pointed not only to the spoilage of this meat but \nalso to the carcinogenic additives used by local companies to retard \nit.  Further compounding this problem is the storage issue: \"Egypt's \nbiggest problem is an inadequate number of refrigeration units to \nstore meat and retard bacterial growth in butcher shops and meat \nsuppliers' facilities.\" \n\n   Industry experts also maintained that factories and shops must \ncomply with existing standards and specifications; however, they \nacknowledged that \"the first step is to guarantee the quality of \nimported meat.\"  While Egypt reportedly has procedures in place to \nguarantee the quality of imports upon arrival, elimination of the \n\"meat mafia\" requires \"enforcement of (existing) food laT?s.\"  AL- \n                                                        ? \nWAFD has asked the ministers of health and industry to \"confront the \ndemands of the distributors\" and wondered whether \"the health and \nmanufacturing agencies will carry out their role.\"  (Cairo AL-WAFD \n23, 24 Jan 94) \n\n   Suez Canal Bridge Planned \n\n   President of the Suez Canal Agency Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil \nannounced that an agreement had been concluded with Minister of \nTransportation Sulayman Mitwalli to begin construction of a bridge \nover the Suez Canal to further development in the Sinai and ease the \ngrowing transit traffic in the area.

        "text": "\n\nBeijing     Rejects Political Compromise, Plays Down Economic \nThreats \n                           SUMMARY \n   PRC authoritative media have reacted strongly to the Hong Kong \nLegislative Council (Legco)'s adoption of the first stage of \nGovernor Christopher Patten's democratic reforms and to a Hong \nKong government \"White Paper\" on the contents of the aborted 1993 \nChina-British talks, ruling out further negotiations with the \nBritish and reaffirming China's previous decision to dismantle \nany political institutions based on Patten's reforms after 1997. \nAt the same time, in an apparent effort to reassure foreign \ninvestors and avoid actions that could jeopardize the European \nCommunity's support for Beijing's GATT application, PRC media \nhave portrayed senior Chinese leaders as backing away from recent \nthreats to retaliate against British firms. \n                          END SUMMARY \n   Beijing's rejection of further negotiations with Britain over \nHong Kong's political future was authoritatively conveyed by a \nspokesman of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State \nCouncil on 24 February and reaffirmed by a Foreign Ministry \nspokesman the same day.  The Chinese were reacting to the passage \nby Legco on 24 February of the first stage of Patten's political \nreforms and Patten's announcement the same day that he would \nformally submit the remainder of his reforms to Legco on 9 March \nand would publish a White Paper on the contents of the 17 rounds \nof talks with the PRC in 1993 on Hong Kong's political future \n(Hong Kong Asia television, 24 February).  Asserting that Beijing \nwould make good on its previous threats to terminate negotiations \nand dismantle political institutions established without Chinese \nconsent if Legco adopted Patten's proposals, the Foreign Ministry \nspokesman declared that \"the door of the negotiations has been \nclosed by the British side\" and \"the framework of the \npolitical system\" established by Legco \"cannot last beyond June \n30, 1997.\"  Responsibility for \"the disruption of cooperation \nbetween China and Britain\" on this issue, he said, \"rests \nentirely with the British\" (Xinhua, 24 February). \n   Signaling Beijing's determination to accelerate plans to \nestablish its own institutions to govern Hong Kong after the \ntakeover, Premier Li Peng declared on 25 February during a \nsession with members of the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC)--a \ngroup established last summer under the National People's \nCongress to prepare for the Hong Kong transition--that the \"PWC's \nburdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and \ngreater\" and called upon the members to \"work harder and make \neven greater contributions to Hong Kong's long-standing stability \nand prosperity\" (Xinhua).  Similarly, Lu Ping, director of the \nState Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, warned that the \nBritish were \"trying to mislead Hong Kong people\" by \"spreading \nthe view\" that the Hong Kong government based on Patten's reforms \n\"will not be terminated after 1 July 1997\" and called for \n\"speeding up the working pace of the PWC\" (Zhongguo Xinwen She, \n26 February) \n   Countering the White Paper \n   In an apparent effort to bolster its political support in Hong \nKong, the PRC also mounted a media campaign to discredit the \nBritish White Paper's version of the 1993 talks, first attacking \nits credibility and Patten's motives, then issuing its own \nversion of the talks on 28 February (Xinhua).  Zhang Junsheng, \ndeputy director of Xinhua's Hong Kong branch, said in a 24 \nFebruary interview that Britain's \"unilateral move\" to publicize \nits version of the negotiations was intended to \"deceive Hong \nKong people and mislead public opinion\" (Xinhua).  On 28 \nFebruary, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, commenting on a \nlengthy Foreign Ministry version of what he claimed were the \n\"facts\" concerning the talks, asserted that Patten's decision to \npublish the White Paper was \"designed\" to \"shirk its \nresponsibility for the rupture of the talks\" (Xinhua, 28 \nFebruary).  In the text of the document, publicized by Xinhua \nthat day, Beijing reiterated its position that the \"core of the \ncontroversy\" was not about \"whether democracy should be promoted\" \nas claimed by the British but \"whether international commitments \nshould be honored.\" \n   Economic Reprisals Played Down \n   Despite the current political deadlock between the Chinese and \nBritish over Hong Kong's political future, Beijing has, at least \nfor now, backed away from its recent threats of economic \nreprisals against British firms and signaled its interest in \nlongterm British investment.  For example, backing away from \nMinister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu \nYi's 28 January warning that the British Government's \n\"uncooperative attitude\" on Hong Kong \"is likely to affect Sino- \nBritish trade ties\" (Xinhua, 28 January), PRC Vice President \nRong Yiren was depicted by Xinhua on 24 February as cautiously \noptimistic about the prospects for British investment \nopportunities in China.  In a meeting that day with the chairman \nof the prominent British multinational company John Swire and \nSons, Rong reiterated Beijing's contention that Britain's \n\"uncooperative approach\" was to blame for the \"current \ndifficulties on the Hong Kong issue,\" but he went on to emphasize \nthat both China and the British firm were \"confident\" about the \neconomic prospects of Hong Kong and China and to observe that \nSwire \"had been enlarging its business\" in the region.  Xinhua \nportrayed the British chairman as \"willing\" for his company to \nengage in \"long-term investment in Hong Kong and the Chinese \nmainland.\" \n   Further suggesting a return to a more conciliatory approach on \neconomic relations, top Chinese officials have assured foreign \ninvestors and the Hong Kong business community that its \nuncompromising attitude on political reforms in Hong Kong will \nnot adversely affect economic ties.  For example, Vice Premier \nZhu Rongji reaffirmed China's commitment to the territory's \ncapitalist system after the takeover during a 25 February press \nconference in Tokyo when he \"reiterated\" that China \"will not \nchange the system in Hong Kong after 1997\" (Xinhua, 25 February). \nHe went on to reassure the business community that \"the Chinese \nGovernment will continue to protect the interests of foreign- \nfunded firms\" in Hong Kong. \n   Beijing's efforts to play down prospects of retaliation against \nBritish firms may be linked in part to China's desire for \ncontinued European Community (EC) support for its membership in \nGATT.  PRC media used the recent visit to Beijing of EC Trade \nCommissioner Leon Brittan to provide an upbeat assessment of EC \nbacking for China's application to GATT.  Xinhua of 28 February \nreported that Brittan, at a joint news conference with MOFTEC \nminister Wu Yi that day, announced that it would be \"economically \nbeneficial\" for \"China and the whole world\" to have China in \nGATT.  Suggesting Beijing's efforts to avoid any overt threats of \neconomic reprisals, PRC media were not observed to carry Western \nmedia accounts that EC Commissioner Brittan--in a response to Wu \nYi's assertion during the press conference that the political row \nwith Britain could affect economic ties--warned sharply that \nretaliation against British firms would be \"completely \nunacceptable\" to Europe (London Daily Telegraph, 1 March). \n   Implications \n   Beijing's refusal to compromise on Patten's political reforms and \ndetermination to proceed with the establishment of a shadow \ngovernment in preparation for restructuring Hong Kong's \nlegislative institutions after 1997 reflects both Beijing's drive \nto ensure total political control over Hong Kong after the \ntakeover and the acute sensitivity of China's ageing leaders to \nperceived threats to China's \"sovereignty,\" including political \npressure on senior leader Deng Xiaoping who has staked his \nreputation on reclaiming Hong Kong from its colonial past.  At \nthe same time, China's decision to return to a more conciliatory \napproach on economic relations likely reflects efforts to avoid \njeopardizing EC support for its GATT membership, and may signal a \nleadership view that, given the failure of economic reprisals to \ndeter Legco from passing democratic reforms and Patten from \nsubmitting his remaining proposals for a vote, Hong Kong's \nstability is best served by maintaining strong ties to the \nBritish business community. \n   (AUTHOR: SIMON.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                                  Apparently responding to domestic pressures to demonstrate more \nbalance in the country's foreign policy, Russian Foreign Minister \nAndrey Kozyrev used his late January visit to China to press \nBeijing to greatly expand and deepen the Sino-Russian \nrelationship and forge a \"constructive partnership\" between the \ntwo countries.  For its part, Beijing, concerned about the \nunsettled Russian political situation, appeared reluctant to \nembrace Kozyrev's initiative, suggesting instead a more modest \nexpansion of bilateral ties. \n\n                              END SUMMARY \n\n   Visiting China from 26 to 29 January, Kozyrev--the first high- \nranking Russian visitor to Beijing since the mid-December \nelections in Russia--not only reaffirmed Moscow's intention to \nmaintain its relationship with Beijing but also called for \nsignificantly expanding those ties and creating what he called a \n\"constructive partnership\" between the two countries. \nIntroducing this initiative at a press conference on 26 January, \nKozyrev said a \"constructive partnership\" between the two \ncountries would mean a \"qualitatively higher-level\" of bilateral \nties (ITAR-TASS, 26 January).  Expanding on this theme in a \nspeech the following day to China's People's Institute of \nDiplomacy, the Russian foreign minister portrayed the new \nrelationship as a multifaceted one (ITAR-TASS, 27 January). \nBeijing and Moscow, he indicated, should cooperate in solving the \n\"new problems\" in Asia, focusing on the \"danger\" from the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies, the \nquestion of access to the resources of the Pacific Ocean, and the \nproblems caused by an \"upswing of religious nationalism\" in \nAfghanistan and Tajikistan.  Kozyrev went on to underscore the \nimportance of cooperation in these areas, saying that the failure \nto make \"joint efforts\" to resolve these problems would result in \na \"very explosive\" situation.  In addition to cooperation on \nregional problems, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive \npartnership would lead to greater Sino-Russian cooperation in the \ninternational arena, particularly in the UN Security Council on \nproblems such as peacekeeping operations in Tajikistan and \nnuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. \n   Economic Relations and High-Level Visits \n\n   Kozyrev also pressed his Chinese hosts to raise the level of \neconomic relations between the two countries, saying, in a press \nconference on 28 January, that the constructive partnership \n\"presupposes\" a transition to a \"higher level and more stable\" \nforms of economic cooperation (ITAR-TASS, 28 January).  In \nparticular, he pointed to the need to change the \"form\" of cross- \nborder contacts from \"petty commercial dealings to large joint \nprojects.\"  Elaborating on the economic aspect of his \nconstructive partnership, Kozyrev, in remarks aired by Moscow's \nMayak radio on 31 January, said that Russia would \"cOunt on\" \nChinese support in getting Russia \"included\" in plans for \nregional economic cooperation.  In addition, he noted that Russia \nwas \"very interested\" in participating in modernizing those \nChinese industrial enterprises which were originally set up by \nMoscow and was \"ready\" to participate in major economic \ndevelopment projects like the Three Gorges hydroelectric project. \n\n   Finally, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive partnership \nproposal demands increasing the number of high-level contacts \nbetween Moscow and Beijing.  At his 28 January press conference, \nhe claimed that this aspect of his initiative had already been \naccepted, saying that his visit had \"mapped out a program\" of \nexchanges which would be capped by a visit to Moscow by PRC \nPresident and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang \nZemin. \n\n   Moscow's Positive Assessment \n\n   Moscow was upbeat in assessing the results of Kozyrev's visit. \nCommenting on Kozyrev's 27 January meeting with PRC Foreign \nMinister Qian Qichen, for example, Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's \npolitical adviser, claimed that the two ministers had agreed to \ncontinue a \"progressive and constant exchange of views and visits \nat summit and high-levels\" (ITAR-TASS, 27 January).  She noted \nthat Jiang Zemin would visit Moscow in the \"third quarter\" and \nthat his visit would be preceded by trips to Beijing by Russian \nPremier Viktor Chernomyrdin and to Moscow by Foreign Minister \nQian.  She noted that the two sides had indicated their \n\"readiness\" to continue negotiating their border problems and had \n\"decided\" to maintain the \"status quo\" on the border after it had \nbeen demarcated.  She also claimed that the two foreign ministers \nhad expressed their \"mutual interest\" in further developing \n\"constructive cooperation\" in the military-technical sphere. \n\n   A 29 January ITAR-TASS report on the visit was even more positive \nin assessing the results of the Kozyrev-Qian talks.  It said that \nthe foreign ministers had \"confirmed their mutual desire\" for the \ndevelopment of political, trade, economic, and military \ncooperation and pointed to the need to raise the level of Sino- \nRussian relations.  According to ITAR-TASS on the 31st, Kozyrev \nwas also upbeat in assessing the results of the visit in remarks \nwhile made on route to Moscow.  He claimed that with the visit \nChina and Russia had established \"new relations characterized by \nnormal cooperation\" and that the relationship now contained \n\"elements of geostrategic mutual understanding.\"  He also \nportrayed Beijing as receptive to his proposal for a constructive \npartnership, claiming that Chinese leaders had been \"very \nbalanced and positive in principle\" in their response to his \ninitiative. \n\n   Cautious Chinese Reaction \n\n   Reflecting China's longstanding wariness about dealings with \nMoscow as well as its concern about the unpredictable political \nsituation in Russia, Beijing was considerably more circumspect in \nits treatment of Kozyrev's visit and his suggestion that the two \ncountries rapidly expand their relationship.  Reflecting \nBeijing's desire for a slower pace of development of bilateral \nrelations, Qian, according to a 27 January Xinhua account \nof his meeting with Kozyrev that day, underscored the importance \nof \"maintaining and developing long-term, good neighborly, \nfriendly, mutually beneficial, and cooperative relations\" between \nthe two countries, but did not repeat Kozyrev's optimistic \npredictions of a rapid expansion of ties.  While Qian, in \nresponse to Kozyrev's call for \"summit\" meeting between the \nleaders of the two countries \"this year,\" said that China \nattaches \"importance\" to maintaining \"dialogue and contacts\" \nbetween the leaders of the two countries, he seemed to dismiss \nthe idea, pointedly noting that documents signed during Russian \nPresident Boris Yeltsin's 1992 visit to China as still being \ncarried out \"step by step.\" \n\n   Judging by Xinhua accounts of their 28 January meetings with \nKozyrev, Li Peng and Jiang Zemin also counselled a more moderate \napproach to developing bilateral ties (28 January).  Li, for \nexample, was reported by Xinhua as telling Kozyrev that the \n\"correct\" policies agreed to during Yeltsin's 1992 visit should \nbe \"adhered to for a long period.\"   Turning to economic matters, \nhe suggested that the two sides need to \"proceed from reality\" \nand \"explore new ways\" of bilateral cooperation.  Jiang similarly \nseemed to advocate a more cautious approach, telling Kozyrev that \nbilateral relations are \"developing steadily\" and noting that \nChina's \"firm and unwavering\" policy is to \"maintain and develop \nlong-term and steady good neighborly and friendly\" relations with \nRussia. \n\n   Like Qian, Jiang also expressed reservations about Kozyrev's \nproposal for a summit meeting this year.  According to Xinhua, \nJiang, in response to Yeltsin's invitation to visit Russia, \nmerely \"expressed the hope\" that the visit \"can be materialized \nat an appropriate time.\"  However, the Xinhua report on Li Peng's \nmeeting with Kozyrev did indicate that Beijing would accept a \nvisit to Beijing by Chernomyrdin, noting that Li \"invited\" the \nRussian premier to visit China. \n\n   Further underscoring Beijing's more circumspect approach to the \nrelationship, Chinese media reporting on the visit gave short \nshrift to Kozyrev's proposal for a constructive partnership, \nfailing to report his 27 January speech to the People's Institute \nof Diplomacy outlining the initiative.  In addition, Xinhua \naccounts of Kozyrev's meetings with Qian on 27 January and with \nJiang Zemin the following day did not indicate that Kozyrev had \npresented his proposal to them during the talks (27, 28 January). \nWhile the 28 January Xinhua report on Kozyrev's meeting with Li \nsaid that the Russian foreign minister had stated that in today's \n\"turbulent world\" the \"constructive partnership\" between the two \nsides should be \"enhanced and reach new heights,\" it did not \nindicate that Li made any response to Kozyrev's initiative. \n\n   Prospects \n\n   Despite Chinese concerns about the Russian political situation, \nBeijing and Moscow are likely to continue expanding their \nrelationship.  However, Beijing, anxious to avoid any \nentanglements or fallout from the unsettled political situation \nin Russia, will remain cautious as it proceeds in developing \nthose ties.  Beijing will continue respond positively to Moscow's \ndesire for greater economic cooperation.  In addition, the \ninclusion of Deputy Defense Minister General Boris Gromov as a \nmember of Kozyrev's delegation suggests that military cooperation \nwill remain a key part of the Sino-Russian relationship. \n\n(AUTHOR:  HEBBEL.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                               Pyongyang has made a point of reminding Washington that linking \nthe resumption of bilateral high-level talks to the exchange of \nspecial envoys by North and South Korea could jeopardize ongoing \ninternational nuclear inspections.  The North continues to signal \nits reluctance to engage the South in any substantive dialogue \nbeyond the bare minimum required for the convening of the DPRK- \nU.S. talks. \n\n                         END SUMMARY \n\n   To draw attention to Pyongyang's stance, Vice Foreign Minister \nKang Sok-chu, head of the North Korean delegation to last \nsummer's high-level talks with the United States, took the \nunusual step of issuing his own \"press statement\"(SEE NOTE) on 4 \nMarch.  Kang's statement claimed that there were no preconditions \nstipulated in the 25 February DPRK-U.S. agreement for resumption \nof bilateral talks.  The statement, carried in full by KCNA and \nPyongyang radio the same day, also complained that Washington is \nusing the exchange of envoys and IAEA inspections as \npreconditions for suspension of Team Spirit and the convening of \nhigh-level North Korea-U.S. talks, set for 21 March in Geneva. \n\n   (NOTE: A press statement is typically issued in the name of a \nForeign Ministry spokesman.  This is only the second time Kang \nhas been observed to issue a press statement of his own.  Kang \nissued a press statement last November calling for a \"package \nsolution\" to resolve the deadlocked nuclear issue (Trends of 17 \nNovember 1993, pages 15-17)--a step that eventually led to the 25 \nFebruary agreement.) \n\n   Focusing on the special envoys issue, Kang claimed in his 4 March \nstatement that the 25 February agreement only mentioned \nresumption of working-level contacts to discuss the topic and not \nrealization of the exchanges.  His statement also implied that \nany U.S. insistence that the envoy exchange precede resumption of \nhigh-level talks could jeopardize IAEA inspections.  Reiterating \nPyongyang's depiction of Seoul as irrelevant to discussions of \nthe nuclear issue, Kang contended that the South has neither \n\"political wherewithal\" nor \"authority\" to discuss the nuclear \nissue.  Implying that the North will agree to exchange envoys on \nnon-nuclear issues only, Kang claimed that \"only when\" the South \nstops the \"unjustifiable act\" of trying to push its way into the \ndiscussion of the nuclear issue and makes a \"clear switch\" toward \nseeking national unification can the exchange of special envoys \ntake place.  Kang said that \"reintroducing unjustifiable \npreconditions\"--conditions that he claimed the United States had \ntried but failed to include in the 25 February agreement--can \nbeen seen only as \"an element capable of destroying the full \nimplementation\" of the agreement. \n\n   In a 7 March followup commentary, the party paper Nodong Sinmun \nsimilarly cautioned Washington against creating \"artificial \ndifficulties\" by setting preconditions.  The commentary urged a \n\"strict observance\" of unspecified \"principles\" set forth in last \nJune's DPRK-U.S. joint statement (KCNA, 7 March). \n\n   Inter-Korean Dialogue     In line with Pyongyang's posture, North \nKorean media have characterized the \"fourth\" inter-Korean \nworking-level meeting on the exchange of presidential envoys, \nheld on 3 March, as having made no progress.  The North Korean \nchief delegate introduced two new demands (Pyongyang TV, 3 March) \nin addition to the previously raised issues of 1) stopping all \n\"nuclear exercises\" and 2) renouncing the \"international \ncooperative system\" (Pyongyang TV, 25 October 1993)--that is, \nseeking cooperation with the United States and Japan to apply \npressure on Pyongyang on the nuclear issue, with attendant \nreferences to UN-imposed sanctions.  The two new conditions are \nthat Seoul: \n\n   + Call off its effort to bring in Patriot missiles. \n\n   + Withdraw \"remarks\" that it will not \"shake hands\" with the \nNorth, an oblique reference to the remarks South Korean President \nKim Yong-sam made last June. \n\n   Also suggesting that the North Korean leadership is not quite \nready to engage the South in serious discussions, Pyongyang media \nhave continued their harsh personal attacks on ROK President Kim. \nThe latest attack came in a 4 March KCNA dispatch criticizing the \nremarks made by Kim to Seoul radio, which, according to KCNA, \nshowed that Kim is a \"heinous traitor\" and a \"dyed-in-the-wool \nflunkeyist.\"  The only sign so far that Pyongyang does not want \nto totally foreclose the avenue of dialogue for now is the fact \nthat the North Korean chief delegate at the 3 March meeting \nrefrained from directly naming President Kim in his remarks at \nthe talks, as reported by North Korean media. \n\n   Background     The idea of exchanging presidential special envoys \nwas first advanced by the North last May to deal with \"all \nissues\" related to national unification, most likely as a fall \nback position on the eve of the first round DPRK-U.S. nuclear \ntalks, then slated for 2 June.  Subsequently, after much \nwrangling, three preliminary meetings were held to discuss \nprocedural matters and agenda.  However, on the eve of a fourth \nworking-level contact, scheduled for 4 November, the North called \noff the meeting to protest remarks by the South Korean defense \nminister, who, Pyongyang claimed, had hinted at the possibility \nof a preemptive strike against North Korean nuclear facilities \n(Yonhap, 3 November 1993).  Moreover, even while reluctantly \nagreeing to the latest round of inter-Korean contacts, Pyongyang \nhas still maintained that the nuclear issue must be resolved \nbilaterally between the DPRK and the United States. \n\n   Implications     Although couched in tough language, Kang's \nwarning against \"preconditions\" did not rule out the possibility \nthat envoys may be exchanged before 21 March.  In fact, \nPyongyang's stance may be designed to test Washington's resolve \nto stand behind Seoul as the latter navigates the waters of \ninter-Korean dialogue.  Therefore, while Pyongyang's hardened \nstance at the North-South talks may represent posturing for \nbargaining, its continued personal attacks on ROK President Kim \nsuggests that the North is still reluctant to reach any agreement \nof substance with the South at present and is proceeding with \ninter-Korean talks solely to meet requirements for the resumption \nof high-level DPRK-U.S. talks. \n   (AUTHOR:  YIM.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                                 Russian President Boris Yeltsin is carrying out yet another \nreorganization of his presidential apparatus, this time clearly \nto help him expand presidential power vis-a-vis parliament and \nthe cabinet.  The new constitution pushed through by Yeltsin \nafter disbanding the Supreme Soviet gives the president more \ncontrol over the cabinet and the rest of government, and the \ncurrent reorganization is being justified by the need to expand \nhis staff to exercise these expanded powers.  The strengthening \nof the president's apparatus and especially his analytical and \npolicy making staff is important for the prospects for reform \nsince with a unsympathetic parliament and a less reformist \ncabinet, reform policies more than ever depend on a strong \npresident. \n\n                        END SUMMARY \n\n   Since December Yeltsin has been creating new agencies directly \nsubordinate to the president, adding new assistants, expanding \nthe Security Council structure, and now is preparing an edict to \nreorganize and strengthen his \"Administration\" (the presidential \nstaff).  Although he has apparently not yet signed the edict, the \nreasons for the reorganization and its main features are being \nwidely reported in the press.  Administration leaders have \nclaimed that the main reason for the reorganization is that \nbecause of the president's increased powers under the new \nconstitution, he requires a bigger staff to help him initiate \npolicies and run more of the government.  Administration Leader \nSergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS on 15 February that the additional \npresidential powers in the new constitution necessitate \nreorganization of the Administration and that a new economic \nanalysis service, finance and budget directorate, and \ninternational department are being created to help the president \nstay \"well informed\" on the economy, budget, and tax policy. \nNikolay Medvedev, head of the Administration's Directorate for \nWork with Territories and Presidential Representatives, also \nstated that the Administration was to be reorganized to bring it \ninto line with the new constitution (Segodnya, 19 January). \n\n   Reports of an impending reorganization of the Administration \nbegan to appear in early January (Kuranty, 5 January; Georgiy \nSatarov to ITAR-TASS on 5 January; Segodnya, 6 January; Nikolay \nMedvedev to Segodnya, 19 January).  Filatov told ITAR-TASS on 21 \nJanuary that Yeltsin would probably sign a decree reorganizing \nthe Administration the next week.  Over three weeks later, the \ndecree had not appeared but he again told ITAR-TASS on 15 \nFebruary that Yeltsin would sign the decree in a few days.  On 19 \nFebruary he told Interfax that Yeltsin had the proposals for the \nreorganization on his desk. \n\n   Split Between Filatov and Ilyushin \n\n   The delay was apparently caused by disagreements over two rival \nplans presented by the two main groups in Yeltsin's personal \nstaff--the Administration led by Filatov and Yeltsin's assistants \nand advisers led by First Assistant to the President Viktor \nIlyushin.  Segodnya reported on 6 January that Filatov favored a \nplan worked out by his first deputy, Sergey Krasavchenko, which \nconcentrated analysis in a single center in the Administration, \nwhile Ilyushin backed a plan worked out by members of the \nPresidential Council to expand the role of presidential \nassistants, giving them their own analytical staffs outside the \nAdministration.  Moscow News (4-10 February) also reported that \nFilatov and Ilyushin were pushing rival plans and said that \nYeltsin had not yet chosen which to accept.  Kommersant-Daily on \n10 February reported that a compromise plan had been worked out, \nmaking Ilyushin \"for the first time officially equal in status\" \nto Filatov and strengthening the group of personal assistants, \nbut accepting most of Filatov's proposals regarding the \nAdministration's structure (see box on \"Reorganization of \nAdministration\").  News reports of the disagreements apparently \nprompted Filatov and Ilyushin to appear together on the \ntelevision news program \"Itogi\" on 20 February to deny that there \nhad been disagreements and to declare that they have \"a joint, \nagreed on version\" of the Administration reorganization, which \ndivides functions between the Administration and assistants. \nThis compromise arrangement would appear to heighten the \npotential for conflict between the already competing parallel \nstructures of the Administration and staff of assistants by \nmaking them even more independent, rival power bases. \n\n   Other Recent Changes \n\n   Yeltsin's effort to strengthen presidential structures has been \nevident since December in the addition of more personal \nassistants to his staff, his assumption of control over more key \ngovernment agencies, the creation of new organs under the \npresident, and the strengthening of the Security Council's \ncommission structure. \n\n   New Assistants \n\n   Yeltsin has added two new reform-minded assistants (pomoshchniki) \nto his present four, who were less involved in policy, at least \npublicly: \n\n   --He created a new post of national security assistant and named \noutspoken reformer Yuriy Baturin to it on 6 January (Ostankino \nTV, ITAR-TASS, 6 January).  Baturin explained to Interfax (7 \nJanuary) that he would coordinate the activities of the \nintelligence, counterintelligence, and other security services. \nHe had joined Yeltsin's staff as an assistant on legal and \npolitical matters in June (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i \nPravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 7 June 1993, page 2400) on \ncondition that he could continue to speak out publicly (Novaya \nYezhednevnaya Gazeta, 7 July 1993). \n\n   --Sociologist Georgiy Satarov, who as a Presidential Council \nmember has often voiced sharp opinions to newsmen, was named \nassistant to the president on 8 February (Russian TV, ITAR-TASS, \n8 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 9 February), and he explained in \na 12 February Ostankino TV interview that he will handle \npresidential ties with the Federal Assembly and parties and \npublic organizations and constitutional questions.  He has \noccasionally riled Yeltsin with his public remarks (See Note 1) \nand told Rossiyskiye Vesti (12 February) that he feels Yeltsin \nwants him to continue to speak out independently and offer \ndiffering opinions. \n\n   (Note 1)  In October, while Yeltsin was visiting Japan, Satarov \nsuggested presidential elections be held simultaneous with \nparliamentary elections, undercutting Yeltsin's stand and \nprompting Yeltsin to publicly threaten to fire him (Obshchaya \nGazeta, 15-21 October 1993). \n\n   Control Over Power Ministries \n\n   Yeltsin has assumed more control over some key cabinet ministries \nand other government agencies, clearly strengthening his power \nover the most sensitive security and communications agencies to \nprotect himself against potential challenges.  His 10 January \nedict \"On the Structure of Federal Organs of Executive Power\" \nlisted 10 agencies which henceforth will be \"subordinate to the \npresident of the Russian Federation on questions put under him by \nthe Russian Federation Constitution or in accord with legislative \nacts of the Russian Federation\":  the Ministries of Defense, \nInternal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs, the Main Directorate for \nProtection, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Agency \nfor Government Communications and Information, the Federal Border \nService, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Federal \nService for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and the State \nArchive Service (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 January). \n\n   New Presidential Organs \n\n   In recent weeks Yeltsin has created a number of new organs \ndirectly under the president, expanding the already cumbersome \nstructure run directly by the president.  In some cases it is not \nclear if they add to his political- power, but for some reason the \npresident considered it necessary to put them under his direct \ncontrol rather than under the cabinet or elsewhere in the \ngovernment.  In addition to creating the Federal \nCounterintelligence Service and the Federal Border Service \nspecifically under the president in mid and late December: \n\n   --On 31 December Yeltsin issued an edict creating a Judicial \nChamber for Information Disputes (Sudebnaya Palata po \nInformatsionnym Sporam) under the president (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, \n10 January), which apparently can be used to strengthen the \npresident's control over the media.  According to ITAR-TASS, it \nwill be able to decide matters such as allotment of radio and \ntelevision coverage to the parliament and can warn media if they \nviolate the Law on the Mass Media.  Chairman Anatoliy Vengerov \nsaid that the chamber will enforce constitutional provisions on \ninformation rights and assist the president in protecting freedom \nof the press (ITAR-TASS, 5 January).  The new constitution \n\"guarantees the freedom of mass information\" (article 29) and \ndeclares the president \"the guarantor\" of the constitution and \nthe rights and freedoms of citizens (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 \nDecember 1993). \n\n   --On 18 January Yeltsin created a new post for conducting his \ndealings with parliament--the president's plenipotentiary \nrepresentative in the Federal Assembly (polnomochnyy predstavitel \nprezidenta v Federalnom Sobranii--Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 20 January) \nand named legal specialist Aleksandr M. Yakovlev to the post \n(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January). \n\n   --On 12 February Yeltsin created a \"Directorate of the Federal \nState Service of the president\" (Upravleniye Federalnoy \nGosudarstvennoy Sluzhby Prezidenta) under his Cadre Policy \nCouncil (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 February).  It is to supervise \nthe new civil service. \n\n   --On 16 February Yeltsin created a Public Chamber \n(Obshchestvennaya Palata) under the president.  Its statute calls \nit a \"consultative organ\" to provide feedback from the public to \nhelp in preparing presidential decisions and indicates it will be \nmade up of representatives of parties, enterprises, religious \ndenominations, trade unions, and other organizations.  It is to \nbe \"coordinated\" by Yeltsin's personal assistant Lev Sukhanov \n(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 19 February).  It held its first meeting on \n19 February (ITAR-TASS, 19 February). \n\n   --On 17 February Yeltsin created a Committee for Information \nTechnology Policy (Komitet po Politike Informatizatsii- \n-Roskominform) subordinate to the president and cabinet to \noversee creation of federal computerization systems, along with \nthe Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information \n(ITAR-TASS, 19 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 23 February). \n\n   --On 25 February Yeltsin created an Expert Legal Council \n(Ekspertno-Pravovoy Sovet) under the president--another \nconsultative, part-time body.  It will be chaired by State-Legal \nDirectorate Chief Ruslan Orekhov and a Moscow lawyer, Igor \nBezrukov (ITAR-TASS, 25 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 March). \n\n   Security Council Expansion \n\n   The president's Security Council, second only to the cabinet as a \nhighlevel executive body, has become more active, with new \ncommissions being formed under it and those created earlier being \nactivated.  Although a 1 February Yeltsin edict (ITAR-TASS, 1 \nFebruary) dropped economic officials (the ministers of the \neconomy and finance) in listing the new membership of the \nSecurity Council--appearing to remove economic questions from its \npurview--the expansion of the council's working commissions, \nincluding one on economic security, appears to broaden its \nactivities, rather than reduce them.  A 3 March Kommersant-Daily \narticle argued that the role of the Security Council may increase \nsubstantially since it is the best organ for Yeltsin to use to \ngovern, given the independence of the cabinet under Premier \nViktor Chernomyrdin and the lack of a reformist majority in the \nDuma. \n\n   --An Interdepartmental Commission on Information Security was \ncreated by a Yeltsin decree on 18 December.  The new commission \nheld its first meeting on 13 January and began working on its \n\"main task\"--working out state policy for information security \n(ITAR-TASS, 13 January). \n\n   --The council's Interdepartmental Commission for Defense Security \nheld its first meeting on 29 December.  Its chairman is First \nDeputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and members include \ndeputy ministers of the economy and internal affairs, deputy \nchief of staff, and the  border guards commander (ITAR-TASS, 29 \nDecember). \n\n   --The first meeting of the council's Interdepartmental Commission \non Economic Security was held on 10 January, under Chairman \nAndrey Zverev, concurrently head of the economic department of \nthe cabinet (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11 January). \n   --The first meeting of the council's Interdepartmental Commission \nfor Public Security was held on 18 January, chaired by Deputy \nInternal Affairs Minister Aleksandr Kulikov (ITAR-TASS, 18 \nJanuary). \n\n   --Yeltsin on 31 January signed an edict outlining the duties of \nthe Security Council's Scientific Council--defining priorities \nfor scientific research in the security sphere--and naming Vice \nPresident of the Academy of Sciences V. Purimov chairman (Mayak \nRadio, 31 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February).  Yeltsin had \ncreated the council with a 1 November decree (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, \n3 February). \n\n   Implications \n\n   With a hostile parliament and a cabinet led by an apparently \nloyal but less reformist Premier Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin appears to \nbe building up presidential structures that, aided by stronger \npresidential powers in the new constitution, will enable him to \npress reform policies on his own.  His expanding group of \nspecialists, analysts, and policy-oriented assistants may enable \nhim to develop more effective policies and establish better \ncontrol over the government, more effectively competing with an \nassertive Duma or cabinet.  He has, however, reorganized his \npresidential structures before, for example, bringing Filatov in \nto strengthen his Administration in early 1993, and his staff's \neffectiveness still appears to leave something to be desired. \nMoreover, by perpetuating parallel structures--the Administration \nled by Filatov and the staff of assistants under Ilyushin--the \nnew reorganization preserves great potential for competition and \nconflict within the presidential apparatus. \n\n   Box \n\n                Reorganization of the Administration \n\n   Although Yeltsin has apparently not yet signed an edict \nreorganizing the whole Administration, the features of such a \nreorganization have been described in accounts and charts \npublished in Segodnya on 9 February and Kommersant-Daily and \nNovaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta on 10 February, and several edicts \nreorganizing parts of the Administration have already appeared \n(abolishing the Directorate for Information Resources in early \nFebruary, creating a Finance-Budget Directorate on 28 February, \nand creating a Directorate for Information Supply on 3 March). \nAccording to these accounts, the new structure of the \nAdministration aims to: \n\n   --Improve analysis by combining the present three analytical \ncenters and a newly created \"Situation Room\" (Situationnaya \nKomnata) into one \"Analytical Service\" (Analiticheskaya Sluzhba), \nwhich will probably employ on a fulltime basis many of the \npresent part-time presidential analysts (Kommersant-Daily, 10 \nFebruary).  According to the 6 January Segodnya, the poor \nperformance of the present analytical centers during the December \nelection--in analyzing voters' attitudes, predicting the outcome, \nand analyzing the results--was one of the reasons for the Filatov \nand Ilyushin reorganization proposals. \n\n   --Improve economic and foreign policy expertise, probably to make \nthe president less dependent on the cabinet for advice on these \nissues.  The reorganization adds a \"Service of Economic Analysis\" \n(Sluzhba Ekonomicheskogo Analiza), a \"Finance-Budget Directorate\" \n(Finansovo-Byudzhetnoye Upravleniye), and an \"International \nDepartment\" (Mezhdunarodnyy Otdel). \n\n\n                     Presidential Administration Structure \n\n      Old1                 Present Leader          New2 \n\n   Leader (Rukovoditel) \n of the Administration     Filatov \nFirst deputy             Krasavchenko \nDeputy                     Volkov \n                           Voykov3 \nAnalytical Center                       Analytical Service \n for General Policy        Rakitov      (combines centers) \n for Socioeconomic Policy  Filippov \n                                        Situation Room (new) \n for Special Presidential               Center for Presidential \n  Programs                 Malyshev      Programs \n                                        Main Directorate for \n                                         Special Programs of \n                                         the President \nDirectorate for Planning                Directorate for Planning \n and Implementing Special                and Implementing \n Program                                 Special Programs \n                                        Service for Economic \n                                        Analysis (new) \n                                        Finance-Budget \n                                         Directorate4 (new) \n                                        International Department \n                                         (new) \nState-Legal Directorate    Orekhov      State-Legal Directorate \nCenter for Operational                  Center for Operational \n Information               Remizov       Information \nDepartment for Letters                  Department for Letters \n and Reception             Mironov      and Reception \nDirectorate for Information             Directorate for Supply \nResources5            Kupriyanovskiy     of Information (new)6 \n\nArchive                    Korotkov     Archive \nLibrary                                 Library \n                                        Library of Moscow Kremlin \n                                         (new) \nPublishing House           Bunin        Publishing House \nControl-Oversight                       (not in new charts) \nCouncil under leader7     Surkov \nControl Directorate8     Ilyushenko     State Control Directorate \nDirectorate for Work with               Directorate for Work with \nTerritories and Presidential            Territories \nRepresentatives9           Medvedev \n                                        Department for Ties with \n                                         Parties and Public \n                                         Organizations (new) \nOrganizational Department   Chernov     Organizational Department \nDirectorate for Cadres     Rumyantsev   Directorate for Cadres \nDirectorate of Affairs 10   Borodin     Directorate of Affairs \nDirectorate for Handling                Directorate for Handling \nWork11                                  Work \n                                        Department for Secret \n                                        Work12 (new) \n                                        Directorate of Federal \n                                         State Service (new) \nFirst Assistant             Ilyushin    First assistant \nAssistants                  Sukhanov    Assistants \n                           Korabelshchikov \n                           Ryurikov \n                                        Baturin (new) \n                                     -  Satarov (new) \n   Speech writers                          Group of Speech Writers13 \nPress secretary             Kostikov    Press secretary \nPress service               Krasikov    Press service \nChancery14               Semenchenko    Chancery \nProtocol Service                        Protocol service \nSecurity Service           Korzhakov    Security Service of \n                                         President \n                                        Main Directorate for \n                                         Protection \n                                        Presidential \n                                        Representatives \nPresidential Council                    Presidential Council \n\n\n\n   1 Based on the 22 February 1993 presidential edict outlining the \nstructure of the Administration after the early 1993 \nreorganization.

Yeltsin fired Vasiliy Kupriyanovskiy as head of the \ndirectorate for \"critical failure in performing his duties\" \n(ITAR-TASS, 22 February).  A 24 February Izvestiya article on the \nabolition of the directorate suggests that the communications \nagency had pushed this move to eliminate a competing information \ncenter.  According to the article, the directorate disseminated \ninformation to localities using a modern computer system and now \nthe agency will control this system. \n\n   6 Yeltsin signed a 3 March edict creating a Directorate for \nSupply of Information and named Petr Filippov (head of the \npresent Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy) to head it \n(ITAR-TASS, 4 March).

After losing \ndeputy premier status in the recent cabinet reorganization, \nShakhray appears to have rebounded by means of a presidential \ndecree giving him special status as a member of the Government \nPresidium.  Although the decree appears to mark at least \nShakhray's partial return to President Boris Yeltsin's good \ngraces, he continues to split with the president on major issues \nsuch as the recent amnesty for Yeltsin's opponents, suggesting \nthe apparent reconciliation may be short-lived. \n                         END SUMMARY \n   A presidential decree dated 12 February elevated newly \nreappointed (See Note 1) Minister of Nationality Affairs and \nRegional Policy Sergey Shakhray above the status of rank-and-file \nRussian government ministers, announcing that he would be \nincluded in the Government Presidium (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 \nFebruary).  According to the Council of Ministers press service, \nShakhray will be the only \"regular\" minister attending the weekly \nmeetings of the Presidium--which also includes Premier Viktor \nChernomyrdin and his four deputies--as a \"full member\" \n(Kommersant-Daily, 15 February) (See Note 2).  Shakhray had made \ninclusion in the Presidium a condition of his acceptance of the \nministerial port folio on 20 January.  After being offered the \nportfolio, Shakhray reportedly said that he would accept only if \nthe Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy Ministry were made \ndirectly subordinate to the premier and he as minister were \nincluded in the Presidium (Interfax, 19 January). \n   (Note 1)  Shakhray was previously chairman of the Russian \nFederation State Committee for Nationality Affairs and Regional \nPolicy, which was changed into a ministry in the post-election \ncabinet reshuffle.  See the Trends of 26 January 1994, pages 16- \n22, for a summary of changes to the cabinet. \n   (Note 2)  On 15 February ITAR-TASS reported that Economics \nMinister Aleksandr Shokhin--also a leader of Shakhray's Party of \nRussian Unity and Accord (PRES)--is a member of the Presidium. \n   Shakhray had held the nationalities portfolio and the rank of \ndeputy premier until Chernomyrdin reorganized the cabinet, \nreducing the number of deputy premiers and redistributing their \nresponsibilities.  The reshuffle decreased the number of deputy \npremiers from six to four, and the remaining deputy premiers were \ngiven more responsibilities  (Mayak Radio, 31 January; ITAR-TASS, \n15 February).  Following the reorganization, Chernomyrdin signed \na decision tasking First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets with the \ncoordination of the activities of 15 ministries, state \ncommittees, and departments (ITAR-TASS, 15 February). \nChernomyrdin's reshuffle also assigned each of the deputy \npremiers oversight over specific areas of social and economic \npolicy but did not explicitly assign the nationalities portfolio \nto any of them, suggesting that Shakhray will have considerable \nlatitude in this area. \n   End of Eclipse \n   Recent media commentary on Shakhray's situation interpreted the \ndecree as a victory for him, ending a period in which his \ninfluence on nationality affairs was visibly declining. \nFollowing his demotion from deputy premier to minister in the \ncabinet reshuffle (ITAR-TASS, 20 January), an article in the 25 \nJanuary issue of Moskovskiy Komsomolets reported that nationality \naffairs were being handled by other officials, leaving Shakhray \nout of the loop on important developments: \n   --Deputy Premiers Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha had been \ngiven joint jurisdiction over nationality affairs, and Shakhray \nwas now complaining that he was being used as a \"front\" instead \nof being \"the man in charge\" of regional policy. \n   --Chernomyrdin had met with Chechen Republic Deputy Premier \nMairbek Mugadayev in disregard of \"Shakhray's directive\" not to \ntreat representatives of the Chechen Government as leaders of an \nindependent republic. \n   --Shakhray had complained tHhat government officials invited him \n\"to study\" Tatarstan's draft \"Treaty on the Mutual Delegation of \nAuthority and Terms of Reference\" only after he expressed in an \nInterfax interview his bewilderment at not being included in the \ntreaty negotiations. \n   Other media reports also noted that Shakhray appeared to be \nlosing influence.  According to Interfax (21 January), \"well- \ninformed\" sources within the government had said that Shakhray \nhad been \"virtually debarred\" from handling regional issues. \nKommersant-Daily reported that before he was elevated to the \nPresidium, Shakhray had been complaining to journalists that \nurgent problems such as Tatarstan and Chechnya were being handled \nwithout his involvement.  Shakhray was also apparently excluded \nfrom a 20 January telephone conference with the heads of \nadministration of \"a number of regions\" discussing preparations \nfor upcoming local elections.  According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta \n(21 January), Presidential Administration Leader Sergey Filatov \nled the conference and Yarov participated. \n   Background to Eclipse \n   Shakhray appeared to overcome what the Moskovskiy Komsomolets \narticle called his \"rather dubious status\" by threatening to \nrefuse to accept reappointment to the nationalities portfolio. \nInterfax (21 January) quoted Shakhray as saying that if \"vital \nissues of regional and nationality policies\" continue to be dealt \nwith \"without participation of the government member responsible \nfor these issues . . . , I will not be able to work in the \ncabinet.\" \n   Shakhray's eclipse from nationality issues and his loss of the \ndeputy premier post were probably retaliation by Yeltsin for \nShakhray's limited support of the president and his reform team \nat crucial moments before and during the December election \ncampaign.  Yeltsin disdained Shakhray's establishment of the \nParty of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) for splitting his reform \nteam and contributing to the reformers' December national \nelection defeat by splitting the vote.  (Although Yeltsin avoided \ndirect association with any party during the national election, \nhe had been perceived as favoring Russia's Choice \"in spirit\" \n(Mayak Radio, 16 October 1993)--inasmuch as many of his close \nassociates formed the party and actively promoted his reforms.) \nDuring the October 1993 crisis, Shakhray pushed for compromise \nand simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections rather \nthan fully supporting Yeltsin's decisions.  Shakhray had also \nundermined Yeltsin's authority at a preparatory regional \nconference by openly disagreeing with Yeltsin's decision to urge \nthe voluntary dissolution of local soviets (Interfax, 6 October \n1993). \n   Outlook \n   Shakhray's special status as a member of the Presidium puts him \non a par, in effect, with the deputy premiers and probably allows \nhim, as he had demanded, to report directly to Chernomyrdin on \nnationality affairs.  The arrangement may also facilitate the \ndivision of labor among the deputy premiers, allowing the cabinet \nto make fuller use of Shakhray's experience in nationality \naffairs and freeing the others to concentrate on priority \neconomic issues.  With Shakhray apparently positioning himself as \na future presidential candidate and staking out positions opposed \nto Yeltsin on key political issues--most recently on the issue of \namnesty for Yeltsin opponents arrested in 0ctober (Interfax, 28 \nFebruary)--Shakhray's apparent return to influence in the cabinet \nmay not last long. \n   (AUTHOR:  NERO.

In an interview \npublished in Der Spiegel on 7 March, Bosnian Serb \"President\" \nRadovan Karadzic sharply denounced the Muslim-Croat federation \nand the confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic \nof Croatia.  Insisting that the Serbs could accept only \"an \nindependent Serbian state\" or unification \"with all other Serbs \nin one state,\" he asserted that only \"political illiterates could \nexpect\" the Bosnian Serbs to live in a \"Croatian-Muslim state.\" \nSuggesting that his remarks to Der Spiegel were a definitive \nstatement of policy, both Belgrade television and the Yugoslav \npress agency Tanjug gave prominent treatment to quotations from \nthe interview (Belgrade TV, 7 March; Tanjug, 8 March). \n   At the same time, while unanimously expressing their opposition \nto signing on to the Washington agreement, Bosnian Serb leaders \nhave not opposed the idea of Muslim-Croatian union.   However, \nthey insist that such a union must not threaten what they define \nas Serbian interests.  Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the \nBosnian Serb assembly, described the idea of a federation or \nconfederation with the Croats and Muslims in one Bosnian state as \n\"out of the question.\"  While Krajisnik  evinced skepticism that \na Muslim-Croatian federation could survive, he did not reject the \nidea out of hand (Tanjug, 5 March).  Bosnian Serb \"Foreign \nMinister\" Aleksa Buha said that the Serbs would never \"return to \nany sovereign and integral Bosnia-Herzegovina.\"  While declaring \nthat he would not oppose a Muslim-Croatian union as long as it \ndid not constitute a threat \"against\" the Serbs, nevertheless he \nspeculated that the federation was intended to \"create a firm \nnegotiating--and possibly military--bloc\" opposed to Bosnian Serb \ninterests (Tanjug, 6 March).    Nikola Koljevic, a vice president \nof the so-called Republic of Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who \nearlier suggested that the Serbs would continue to seek the union \nof \"all Serbian lands\" with \"Mother Serbia\" despite the \nWashington agreement (Vecernje Novosti, 3 March), more recently \nhas praised the agreement as a \"pragmatic move\" in the \"direction \nof peace.\"  He suggested, however, that the Serbs would enter \ninto negotiations on the agreement only in the unlikely event \nthat UN sanctions against Belgrade were lifted (Tanjug, 8 March). \n(AUTHOR:  NASH.

He noted that several Islamic conferences on insurance \nwere held and that they all ended with recommendations, but no \ndecisions. \n\n   Certifying Islamic Interpreters \n\n   Dr. Sabri 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, professor of jurisprudence at al-Azhar \nUniversity, was interviewed, explaining the qualifications needed \nfor someone to interpret the teachings of Islam.  He pointed out \nthat individual interpretation of Islam by qualified and highly \neducated people will remain open \"as long as there is life to prove \nto the world that the Islamic shari'ah is suitable for all times and \nplaces and is consistent with the time in which we live.\" \n\n   Death for Apostates Dictated in Islam \n\n   Writer Hasan Mahmud Khalil, speaking on the issues of death \nsentences for apostates (hadd al-riddah) and religious freedom, \nargued with those who claim that there is nothing called a death \nsentence on apostates because there is no verse in the Koran that \ncalls for punishing a Muslim apostate on earth and that this \ncontradicts religious freedom.  He noted that while it is not \nmentioned in the Koran, it is mentioned in the Sunnah (prophetic \nsayings) and the Sunnah, he said, is the second source of \nlegislation and Islam after the Koran.  He added that Sunnah \ncontains various religious legal rulings.  There was a Sunnah that \nconfirmed what is contained in the Koran and another that explained \nthe Koran.  He further explained that \"Islam protects rights and \nfreedoms, and the first of these freedoms is the freedom of belief \nand expression.  No one is forced to abandon or change his religion. \nA person can choose which religion to believe and accept, but if he \nadopts Islam willingly, he accepts its rules and submits to its \nobligations.  He will be asked about every shortcoming.\"  Khalil \nalso said that \"the punishment for apostasy was legalized to \nsafeguard religion, ensure its course, deter those who wish to enter \nIslam to achieve certain purposes and then return to their \ninfidelity, and purge society of such hypocrites and exploiters of \nreligion.\"  He concluded that apostates are more dangerous to Islam \nthan non-Muslims because they distort religion and deceive many \npeople who are not familiar with Islam.\" \n\n   Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman Defended \n\n   Writer Muntasir al-Zayyat argued, in an article entitled \"Umar \n'Abd-al-Rahman; The Other Side,\" that Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman is being \nheld in the United States on political rather than legal grounds. \nHe said that the indictment issued by the federal court in New York \nin the case of the World Trade Center explosion on 4 September did \nnot include the name of Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, although much \nmedia clamor was raised at the time.  This, al-Zayyat said, \"opens \nthe way for his possible release soon.\" \n\n   Al-Zayyat then recalled that the U.S. Administration several \nmonths ago wanted Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman to leave the country, saying \nthat his entry into the United States was improper.  Describing this \nas \"ridiculous\" and \"surprising,\" he said that if Shaykh 'Umar's \nentry visa, which he received in Khartoum, was wrong, then why did \nno one find fault with his previous 1985 and 1987 entries to the \nUnited States?  He further argued that the U.S. Administration \nwanted to get Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman out and could not explicitly \nexpress that; therefore, it said that he violated immigration laws \nand began looking for a country to take him.  The problem became \nmore complicated, al-Zayyat said, when the Egyptian Government asked \nfor his extradition and the prime minister of Afghanistan agreed to \nreceive him.  This was unacceptable to the U.S. Administration, he \nsaid, adding that the day when 'Abd-al-Rahman's lawyer officially \nrequested that the shaykh be allowed to leave for Kabul, he was \nofficially charged to prevent him from traveling there.  \"Therefore, \nthe problem is not governed by legal considerations, but political. \nIf Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman was treated according to law, he would always \nemerge victorious.\" \n\n   The writer then tried to shed more light on the \"critical and \nfabricated problem\" of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman.  He said: \"The man has \nalways paid for his daring beliefs and views.\"  His freedom has been \nrestricted since the death of former President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, \nwhen he called from the pulpit that no prayers should be made for \nPresident 'Abd-al-Nasir. \n\n   Al-Zayyat then reviewed Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman's struggle for his \nbeliefs in Egypt since that time, noting that he was subjected to \nugly\" torture during his imprisonment from 1981 to 1984 and was \ninsulted and defamed by \"all the media.\" The writer added that when \nhe left prison, he was strong and continued to adhere to his beliefs \nand call for the application of the shari'ah.  He was threatened by \nformer Interior Ministers Zaki Badr and 'Abd-al-Halim Musa and, as a \nresult, left Egypt and has not since returned. \n\n   In further defense of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, the writer said: \"In \nthe case of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, the law worked in his favor. \nHowever, the law now is not respected in Egypt by those who make it. \nThe problem is being tackled on a political basis, and the political \nsituation today is hostile to Shaykh 'Umar and all those who follow \nin his footsteps.\" \n\n   Al-Zayyat continued:  \"The proceedings for the trial of Dr. 'Umar \n'Abd-al-Rahman are being resumed in al-Fayyum at a time when such \nmeasures were suspended in New York.  It is Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al- \nRahman's fate to pay the price for his adherence to his beliefs and \nhis Islamic call.\" \n\n   Islamic \"Subversives\" Beware \n\n   Dr. Sa'd al-Hilwani, history lecturer at the al-Azhar \nUniversity's Arabic language college, warned of attempts by \nsubversive elements to undermine the Muslim religion.  He also \nwarned against moral and religious degeneration as a result of \nimmoral literature, referring in this regard to the question \nsubmitted by Jalal Gharib, an independent deputy of the People's \nAssembly, to the minister of culture on the issue. \n\n(QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, AFRICA/LEVANT \nBRANCH AT (7O3) 733-64O8) \n\nENEAG/09 Mar/POLCHF/TOTF/NEASA Division/CL 9/1604Z MAR \n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\nIn     an apparent effort to gain more influence over Polish TV and \nRadio, President Lech Walesa fired Marek Markiewicz, the chairman \nof the Polish Radio and TV Council whom he had selected a year \nago, after Markiewicz disregarded Walesa's objections to the \nCouncil's candidate for exclusive national broadcasting rights. \nDespite Walesa's repeated assertions that Zygmunt Solorz, an \nemigre businessman and head of Polsat satellite television \nnetwork, was not a \"suitable\" candidate for an exclusive license \nto broadcast nationally (26 February, Warsaw TV), the Council \nformalized its agreement with Solorz on 1 March.  In stating his \nobjections, Walesa pointed to press reports raising questions \nabout what Rzeczpospolita called a Solorz biography \"full of \nmystery and insinuation\" (Rzeczpospolita, 25 February). \n   Apparently referring to reports of Polsat employees' connections \nwith the former communist government, Walesa responded to the \nCouncil's 27 January declaration that Polsat won the broadcasting \nlicense by accusing the Council of placing private television \n\"into communist hands\" (Gazeta Wyborcza, 29-30 January).  Gazeta \nWyborcza also cited a London Financial Times report asserting \nthat Polsat was heavily backed by British press mogul Rupert \nMurdoch, contradicting Solorz's claim that his bid was \"purely \nPolish.\"  During a news conference following the signing of \nSolorz's license, Markiewicz said that his conversation with the \npresident over the license had been \"unpleasant\" and that Walesa \nhad accused the Council of \"accepting a bribe\" (PAP, 1 March). \n   Walesa has often expressed his dissatisfaction with Markiewicz \nand the the Council since the fall of 1993 and may be using the \nselection of Solorz as an opportunity to create a Council more \ndisposed to accept his advice.  Walesa, who has the right by law \nto appoint three members to the nine-member council, selected \nMarkiewicz, a leading member of the Solidarity trade union, last \nMarch when the president was attempting to improve his relations \nwith the trade union (Rzeczpospolita, 10 March 1993).  However, \nas his relations with Solidarity grew increasingly sour \n(Rzeczpospolita, 28 June 1993) and after the Council had \napparently ignored Walesa's advice, Walesa began to criticize \nMarkiewicz and the Council.  For example, Walesa objected to \nMarkiewicz's announcement in June that the Council would crack \ndown on private stations that were broadcasting without the \nCouncil's authority (PAP, 18 June 1993).  He became even more \ncritical of the Council in November, when the Council appointed a \nformer director of Solorz's Polsat to replace Walesa stalwart and \ncurrent presidential adviser Janusz Zaorski as head of public \ntelevision.  Walesa called the appointment a \"major mistake\" \n(Rzeczpospolita, 16 November 1993) and, shortly thereafter, \nforced the Council out of its office in the Belweder \n(Rzeczpospolita, 16 December 1993), demanding that the three \nmembers whom he had selected resign their posts immediately (PAP, \n8 December 1993).  As yet, none of the three has complied. \n   (AUTHOR:  MIHAILOVICH.  QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL \nCHIEF ANALYST/ELAG  (703) 733-6120) \nELAG/GILISON/CL 9/1952Z MAR \n\n\n",

An increasing \nnumber of large industry firms are joining smaller companies in \nreceiving government \"employment adjustment subsidies?? to offset \nlabor costs associated with the layoffs. \n\n   According to the 6 January NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI), Japan's \nauto industry is ??reeling?? from the fall in domestic demand for \nnew cars because of the prolonged recession.  On 5 January, the \nJapan Automobile Dealers Association announced that domestic auto \nsales in 1993 fell for the third straight year to a six-year low. \nSales of cars (excluding minicars), trucks, and buses totaled \n4,887,179 vehicles, down 8.4 percent from 1992, and the lowest level \nsince 1987.  The paper adds that sales have fallen nearly 18 percent \nfrom their peak in 1990. \n\n   Auto exports also have fallen sharply.  According to the Japan \nAutomobile Manufacturers Association, in January 1994 auto exports \nfell by 26.5 percent compared to January 1993 to 390,418 vehicles, \nthe tenth consecutive monthly decline, the 25 February NIKKEI \nreports.  This is the largest drop \"since statistics have been \ncollected\" and the lowest number of vehicles exported in the month \nof January since 1979.  Further, the monthly value of both auto and \nauto parts exports fell 12.6 percent to just over $6.5 billion, the \nfifth consecutive monthly decline, the paper notes. \n\n   Companies Forced To Initiate Temporary Layoffs - According to the \n20 November 1993 ASAHI SHIMBUN, because of the prolonged slump, the \nauto industry is faced with \"excess personnel and production \ncapacity.\"  However, given Japan's lifetime employment system, \ncompanies are unable to simply fire workers and are looking for \nother means to lower labor costs.  One means companies have resorted \nto, according to ASAHI, is \"one-time,\" or temporary layoffs.  Under \nthis arrangement, to reduce production without actually firing \nexcess personnel, firms require that designated workers take \ntemporary layoffs, during which plant operations are halted.  Firms \nmust pay an \"operations shutdown allowance\" equal to or more than 60 \npercent of the employee's average salary, as required by the Labor \nStandards Law. \n\n   To help firms in selected industries during recessionary \ndownturns, in 1975 the Japanese Government initiated an \"employment \nadjustment subsidy system\" through which the Ministry of Labor (MOL) \npays companies a subsidy to offset labor costs \"during temporary \nlayoffs, retraining, and employee transfers,\" ASAHI notes.  To \nreceive these subsidies, firms must first be \"designated\" as being \nin an industry sector experiencing difficulties by the MOL, after \nwhich the firm must specify the conditions of its temporary layoffs \nand petition the MOL for the subsidies.  This designation is \neffective for 1 year, after which the industry may be redesignated \nby the MOL for another year. \n\n   Large Number of Industry Firms Receiving Employment Subsidies - \nIn the auto industry, the auto-body manufacturing sector received \nMOL certification for employment adjustment subsidies in late \nJanuary 1993, according to the 6 February 1993 NIKKEI, following an \nappeal by the Japan Auto-Body Industries Association, which \nrepresents 218 firms.  The MOL eligibility designation was set to \nexpire on 31 January 1994, but, according to the 15 February 1994 \nNIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN, the MOL \"redesignated\" the auto-body sector \nfor another year.  On 1 May 1993 the finished auto assembly sector \nand the auto parts manufacturing sector were also added to MOL's \nlist of industries eligible for employment adjustment subsidies, \naccording to the 3 May 1993 NIKKEI WEEKLY. \n\n   Since the designations were made, the number of companies \nutilizing one-time layoffs has been increasing, reports the 15 \nFebruary 1994 NIKKEI SANGYO.  According to MOL statistics, the \nnumber of finished car makers (including some auto-body assembly \nfirms) who petitioned for labor adjustment subsidies to pay for \ntemporary shutdowns and layoffs mushroomed in late 1993, from five \nfirms in November to 21 in December covering 26,785 employees.  As \nthese firms halted production, in a ripple effect, an increasing \nnumber of auto-body and auto parts firms have had to initiate work \nstoppages, NIKKEI SANGYO reports.  The number of auto-body firms \nundertaking work stoppages in November expanded to 12 and then to 20 \nfirms, while the number of targeted personnel increased from 990 to \n1,515. \n\n   Auto Parts Firms Particularly Hard Hit - Auto parts manufacturing \nfirms have been particularly hard hit by the downturn, according to \nthe 27 January NIKKEI SANGYO.  The number of parts companies \nplanning work stoppages more than doubled, from 136 firms in October \nto 280 in November, while the number of employees involved jumped \nfrom 30,382 in October to 79,201 in November.  Further, according to \nthe 15 February NIKKEI SANGYO, the numbers increased again from \nNovember to December, from 280 to 361 firms.  NIKi?I SANGY0 adds \n                                                 ? \nthat the finished car and auto parts industries do not expect the \nnumber of firms requesting subsidies to fall \"any time soon.\" \nPress Reports on Companies Initiating Layoffs, Requesting \nSubsidies - Although a number of small auto industry firms applied \nfor subsides soon after the MOL made its designations, until October \n1993 no major company had applied.  Subsequently, a number of larger \nauto-related firms plans to initiate temporary layoffs and apply for \nemployment adjustment subsidies.  According to press reports, the \nfollowing companies have initiated temporary layoffs and have \nreceived employment adjustment subsidies: \n\n   Nissan Motor Co.--According the 26 October MAINICHI SHIMBUN, \nNissan announced plans to apply for subsidies after revealing that \nit would stop production for two days in November on one line at its \nTochigi assembly plant, which employs 6,500 people, and institute \ntemporary layoffs on those days to 2,100 production workers.  In \nNovember, Nissan announced it would expand the scope of temporary \nlayoffs to include \"virtually all\" domestic production lines.  The \n18 November MAINICHI SHIMBUN reports that Nissan decided to target \nnearly 15,000 employees and five plants for two-day shutdowns in \nDecember, which would cut production by nearly 4,000 vehicles. \n\n   In December, Nissan announced it would continue to conduct \ntemporary layoffs and production shutdowns in January and February, \naccording to the 18 December YOMIURI SHIMBUN.  In January, Nissan \nhad shutdowns for three days at its Murayama and Yokohama plants, \ntwo days at its Tochigi plant, and one day at its Kyushu plant.  In \nFebruary the company planned layoffs for two days at its Tochigi and \nKyushu plants and one day at the Murayama plant.  According to \nYOMIURI, the Murayama plant will have been closed six days during \nfour consecutive months of temporary shutdowns. \n\n   Mazda Motor Corp.--According to the 26 October MAINICHI, Mazda \ndecided to initiate temporary layoffs of two days in November for \n25,000 of its nearly 30,000 employees throughout the country. \nMAINICHI reports that Mazda also applied for employment adjustment \nsubsidies.  The 25 December Y0MIURI SHIMBUN reports that Mazda, \nfollowing its November layoffs, planned to have four days of layoffs \nin January at its Hofu plant.  Mazda, which is heavily dependent on \nexports, has seen its sales fall for fourteen consecutive months. \n\n   Nissan Diesel Motor--According to the 23 November 1993 NIKKEI, \nNissan Diesel, a heavy-duty truck and bus manufacturer, announced it \nwould initiate two days of temporary layoffs involving nearly 3,700 \nemployees at three different plants.  The company also stated it \nwould apply for government employment adjustment subsidies, and also \nannounced it had reached agreement with its labor unions to cut \nyearend bonuses. \n\n   Sumitomo Wiring Systems--The 26 January 1994 CHUBU SHIMBUN \nreports that Sumitomo Wiring Systems, the third largest manufacturer \nof auto wire harnesses, will initiate one-day shutdowns in February \nand March, affecting more than 4,700 employees.  The firm plans to \napply for employment adjustment subsidies from the MOL.  The \nshutdowns will cover all of the company's offices and eight plants \nin Japan.  It has seen orders for wire harnesses, which account for \nover 90 percent of total sales, plummet nearly 20 percent since \n1990.  If orders do not recover soon, the firm may extend its \nplanned shutdowns beyond March. \n\n   Tsuchiya Manufacturing Co.--According to the 24 January 1994 \nNIKKEI SANGYO, Tsuchiya, an auto parts maker affiliated with Nissan, \nplans to stop production for two days a month at its main plant in \nKawasaki City.  During this time, the salary of full-time employees \nwill be covered by employment adjustment subsidies, but the salaries \nof temporary and part-time employees will be reduced on a prorated \nbasis.  The Kawasaki plant, which among other things produces fuel, \noil, and air filters, accounts for nearly one-third the firm's total \nsales.  The work stoppages will continue \"until demand for auto \nparts has recovered,\" according to company officials.  Further, the \ncompany is considering work stoppages at other plants where \nproductivity is low. \n\n   Other Suppliers Receiving Subsidies Under Different Designations \n- Other major suppliers to the auto industry have resorted to \ntemporary layoffs and have accepted employment adjustment subsidies \nunder other industry designations.  Two major examples, from the \nrubber and steel industry, are as follows: \n\n   Bridgestone Corp.--The 3 December 1993 NIKKEI reports that \nBridgestone, the world's second largest tire manufacturer, announced \nthat it would initiate three and four days of temporary layoffs at \nthe end of December at nine of the its ten tire plants in Japan. \nThe firm will also apply for subsidies.  Layoffs could cover 9,500 \nemployees, or nearly 60 percent of the firm's total payroll. \n\n   According to NIKKEI, the tire industry received its MOL \ndesignation at the end of November, and \"this is the first time \ntemporary layoffs have taken place in the tire industry.\"  Earlier, \nBridges tone decreased the number of operating days from seven to \nfive per week, but even this measure failed to compensate for the \n\"severe\" drop in demand for tires. \n\n   Daido Steel Co.--The world's largest maker of specialty steel and \na major supplier to the auto industry, particularly to Nissan, Daido \nannounced it would receive subsidies for temporary layoffs of nearly \n4,000 personnel at four plants at the end of December and in early \nJanuary, according to the 11 December 1993 YOMIURI SHIMBUN (Chubu \nedition).  While the firm had undertaken temporary layoffs at its \nKawasaki plant, this is its first \"large-scale\" employment \nadjustment.  Daido's sales have fallen for three consecutive years. \n\n   Economic Trends - FEATURE:  Keidanren Role Likely To Change Under \nNew Chairman -- SUMMARY:  On 7 February the Federation of Economic \nOrganizations (Keidanren) selected Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of \nToyota Motor Corp., to succeed Gaishi Hiraiwa as Keidanren chairman, \naccording to press reports.  While Toyoda chairs Japan's largest \nmanufacturing firm, some industrial leaders express concern whether \nhe can successfully lead Japanese industry because of his \npersonality and Toyota's unusual corporate culture.  The press \nanticipates that under Toyoda's leadership, Keidanren will become an \nordinary economic organization\" representing the interests of \nprivate business, rather than acting as a coordinator between \npoliticians, bureaucrats, and the business community. \n\n   On 7 February Keidanren chose Shoichiro Toyoda (68 years old), \nchairman of Toyota Motor Corp. and a Keidanren vice president, to \nsucceed Gaishi Hiraiwa when he steps down as Keidanren chairman in \nMay, according to the 8 February NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN.  (The \ncompany name is rendered \"Toyota\"; the legal family name is \n\"Toyoda.\")  While industrial leaders generally welcomed Toyoda's \nselection, they also expressed concern, based on his background as \nthe owner and chairman of Toyota Motor, according to the 8 February \nMAINICHI SHIMBUN.  The 8 February NIKKEI SANGYO quotes an \nunidentified industrial leader as questioning Toyoda's ability to \nbreak free from \"Toyota egoism\" and lead Japanese industry from a \n\"broader viewpoint.\"  Writing in the 10 February NIKKEI SANGYO, \neditorial staff writer Atsushi Suemura asks whether the head of \nToyota, which is often said to have a \"Mikawa (the old name for \nAichi Prefecture) Monroe doctrine--we don't interfere with you, so \ndon't you interfere with us\"--is qualified to lead the entirety of \nJapanese industries. \n\n   The 8 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI) reports on the \nexpectations--\"which also reflect the concerns \"--industrial leaders \nhave concerning Toyoda.  Masaru Hayami, chairman of Japan's \nAssociation of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), states that he \nwants Toyoda to exhibit strong leadership \"apart from the interests \nof the auto industry.\"  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber \nof Commerce and Industry, says that the key lies in \"how well Toyoda \ncan balance\" the interests of various industries and the interests \nof consumers and corporate shareholders, not as the manager of \nToyota Motor, which has \"always defended the interests of Toyota and \nthe auto industry,\" but as a leader of all industries. \n\n   Concerning Japan-U.S. trade issues, Yoshinari Yamashiro, chairman \nof steel firm NKK Corp., notes that Japan-U.S. friction \"is the \nJapan-U.S. automobile problem,\" according to the 8 February NIKKEI, \nimplying that Toyota Motor should change its corporate philosophy \nand behavior to ease Japan-U.S. trade friction.  The article adds \nthat Toyota Motor \"symbolizes\" Japan's large trade surplus. \n\n   Where Will Keidanren Go Under Toyoda's Leadership? - Writing in \nthe 15 January ASAHI, economic reporter Yomei Tsuji speculates that \nKeidanren may become an \"ordinary economic organization\" under \nToyoda's leadership.  Tsuji assumes that Keidanren will abandon its \nfunction of channelling corporate political contributions to the \npolitical parties.  Since Toyota Motor has devoted itself to \nmanufacturing and selling cars from its Aichi Prefecture base and \nhas avoided involvement in politics in Tokyo, Tsuji expects Toyoda \nto be effective in \"changing Keidanren's relationship with \npoliticians.\" \n\n   In addition, unlike previous Keidanren chairmen who came from the \nsteel, heavy machinery, or electric power industries, industry \nsectors which were \"sponsored\" by the government, Toyoda is a \nrepresentative of \"true\" private sector firms in Japan.  A change in \nKeidanren's chairmanship from a leader of state-sponsored industry \nto a private industry leader, Tsuji maintains, means that Japan's \neconomy has been \"taken from the government's hands.\"  He also notes \nthat since Toyoda comes from the auto industry, which must sell to \nconsumers directly, Keidanren under Toyoda is expected to pay more \nattention to consumer interests, unlike his predecessors, who spoke \nabout \"national interests\" as leaders of \"Japan Inc.\" \n\n   Writing in the 8 February NIKKEI, editorial staff writer Kazuo \nMori notes that Toyoda's Keidanren will no longer play the role of \ncoordinating interests between industry, the politicians, and \nbureaucrats.  Indeed, now it will be difficult for Keidanren to \ncoordinate interests even within private industry.  Mori notes that \nToyota is an \"owner-managed firm, which tends to compete fiercely \nand to pursue only its own interests,'' even though it has become a \ngiant.\"  He observes that the Keidanren's selection of Toyoda \nindicates that \"competition based on market principles\" will be \nemphasized by corporations more than ever.  Japanese practices that \nhinder competition, Mori notes, such as implementing policies \nthrough discussions among political, bureaucratic, and industrial \ncircles, \"will be avoided.\" \n\n   Press Urges Toyoda's Keidanren To Promote Deregulation - On 7 and \n8 February, NIKKEI, SANKEI SHIMBUN, ASAHI, MAINICHI, and YOMIURI \ncarried editorials on Toyoda's selection.  All the editorials urge \nKeidanren under Toyoda's leadership to promote deregulation.  For \nexample, ASAHI points out that Japan's auto industry has grown to \nthe level of the U.S. auto industry because of \"self-initiated \ntechnical innovations and rationalization efforts,\" not by support \nfrom the government, and urges Toyoda to \"boldly promote \nderegulation.\"  MAINICHI, noting that Toyoda himself was a member of \nthe Hiraiwa Study Group, urges him to take the initiative in \npressing the government to implement the Hiraiwa Report and \"further \npromote deregulation.\"  YOMIURI also asks Toyoda to promote \nderegulation to change Japan's economic structure, under which \ncorporations compete for market share or conduct business in a \ncollusive manner.\" \n\n   SANKEI's editorial notes that Keidanren also must change its role \nof being a coordinator between government and industry to being \"a \nrepresentative of private companies.\"  Through channelling corporate \ncontributions to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) the past 40 \nyears, Keidanren has \"directly and indirectly influenced government \npolicy formulation,\" but it now has to \"deal directly with \ngovernment regulators.\"    The editorial urges the Keidanren under \nToyoda \"not be passive\" toward the government concerning regulations \nand administrative guidance, but rather \"assert its opinions and act \nas the leader of private firms in protecting private sector \nvitality.\" \n\n   Profiles Note Similarities Between Toyoda, Hosokawa - The 17 \nJanuary CHUNICHI SHIMBUN points out the many similarities between \nToyoda and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, such as being from a \nwell-known family, from a regional city, and \"somewhat amateurs in \ntheir respective new fields,\" but also observing that \"the era \nrequires such leaders.\"  Toyoda is from a rich family--the eldest \ngrandson of Toyota founder Sakichi Toyoda--and has reached his \ncurrent position \"without any political or financial support from \nthe outside.\"  He is viewed as an honest and sincere person, the \npaper notes, \"but not a tactician or a charismatic leader.\"  Since \nhe has been far removed from Tokyo, Toyoda reputedly has not been \ninvolved in politics and \"is not close to a political party or \npoliticians.\"  He is also viewed as an \"amateur\" industrial leader, \nbecause he had not been involved in the activities of any economic \norganization before becoming a Keidanren vice chairman in 1990. \nToyoda has a doctorate in mechanical engineering and is an \naccomplished engineer. \n\n   According to the 8 February CHUNICHI, Toyoda's stances on various \nissues are as follows: \n\n--Political contributions:  Toyoda thinks politicians should receive \ngovernment support and individual contributions rather than \ncontributions from business.  He realizes this will \"disconnect\" \ncollusion within in the so-called \"iron triangle\" of politicians, \nbureaucrats and corporations. \n\n--Japan-U.S. trade:  Toyoda believes that Japan and the United \nStates should build a trade relationship based on \"harmony and \ncompetition.\"  He has opposed setting numerical targets for Japan's \nimports of automobiles and auto parts. \n\n--Economic structural reform:  He believes that corporations should \npromote self-help efforts to restructure themselves as their own \nresponsibility, while the government should make the Japanese market \nmore open and fair by deregulation. \n\n   FEATURE:  Welfare Payment Increases Will Offset Tax Cuts for \nHouseholds -- SUMMARY:  Japan's proposed increases in welfare and \nnational annuity premium rates will lessen the stimulative effects \nof the government's proposed income tax cuts on the consumption of \nworking households, according to press reports.  The total increase \nin premium payments is estimated to be equivalent to one-fourth the \ntotal estimated gain in disposable income from the income tax cuts, \nthus largely offsetting tax cuts for average-income working \nhouseholds.  The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) claims, on the \nother hand, that retirees will receive annuity increases that \nslightly exceed the total amount of premium increases. \n\n   The MHW has drafted a bill to reform the welfare annuity program \n(for private sector wage earners) and the national annuity program \n(for the self-employed, students, and people without jobs) which \nincludes premium rate increases in FY94, according to the 18 \nFebruary NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN (NIKKEI). The draft bill will be \nsubmitted to the Diet in mid-March for deliberation.  According to \nthe MHW draft, the welfare annuity premium rate will increase from \nthe current 14.5 percent (split equally between employer and \nemployee) to 16.5 percent of monthly salaries effective in October \n1994, increasing to 17.35 percent effective October 1995, and a new \npayment of 1.0 percent (split between employer and employee) of each \nbonus payment effective in April 1995.  Regarding the national \nannuity premium, the current premium amount, which is a fixed 10,500 \nyen ($100), will be raised to 11,100 yen ($106) per month effective \nApril 1994. \n\n   The 26 February NIKKEI reports that total welfare and national \nannuity premium payments by working households will increase by 1.4 \ntrillion yen ($13.3 billion) a year, which is nearly equivalent to \none-fourth the estimated 5.5 trillion yen ($52.4 billion) in income \ntax cuts specified in the 8 February economic stimulus package. \nAccording to MHW's calculations cited by NIKKEI, the total amount of \nwelfare annuity premiums will increase by approximately 2.6 trillion \nyen ($24.8 billion) a year, assuming an average worker's monthly \nsalary of 340,000 yen ($3,200) and 33 million wage earners.  Of this \n2.6 trillion yen ($24.8 billion), 1.3 trillion yen ($12.4 billion) \nwill be paid by wage earners, since employers and employees equally \nsplit premium payments.  The MHW also anticipates that total \nnational annuity premiums will increase by 100 billion yen ($952 \nmillion) a year. \n\n   Premium Hikes Will Wipe Out Tax Cut Gains for Average-Income \nFamilies - According to the 15 February NIKKEI, working households \nwith annual incomes below 6 million yen ($57,000) will realize \nlittle benefit from the income tax cuts due to increases in annuity \npremium payments and other public levies.  Moreover, while the \nincome tax cuts are only for FY94, the premium increases \"will be \npermanent.\"  In the case of a household with an annual income of 6 \nmillion yen ($57,000) or below, an income tax cut of around 71,400 \nyen ($680) or less \"will be largely offset by the increased welfare \nannuity premium payments.\"  Although the MHW claims that welfare \nannuity recipients over 60 years of age will receive 5 percent more \nin benefits from FY94, and therefore the total household disposable \nincome will increase by 3 trillion yen ($28.6 billion), NIKKEI \nargues that incomes will increase \"at the cost of increased burdens \nfor all working households.\" \n\n   More broadly, the NIKKEI article notes that FY94 may be a \"losing \nyear\" for working class households with children in school, since \npostal rates have recently increased; a 9-percent increase in \nnational university tuition has been proposed for 1995; and an \nincrease in Tokyo expressway tolls has been proposed.  The paper \nconcludes that even when workers want to have a bottle of beer after \na hard day's work, a 8.9 yen ($.08) tax increase per bottle will \n\"hurt their thin wallets.\" \n\n   FEATURE:  Economic Organizations Critical of MITI 'Interference' \n-- SUMMARY:  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) \nreportedly faxed a memorandum to four major private economic \norganizations summarizing the \"important points\" of the latest \ngovernment economic stimulus package as well as \"model comments\" to \nbe made by the heads of the four organizations before the Hosokawa \nCabinet approved the package on 8 February, according to press \nreports.  A NIH0N KEIZAI SHIMBUN article on 15 February reported \nthat the economic organizations were very critical of MITI's \n\"interference\" concerning comments by their leaders.  An editorial \nin that newspaper the same day sharply criticizes MITI for \n\"excessive guidance\" of the private sector, observing that it is \n\"quite ironic\" that under the Hosokawa administration, which \nadvocates deregulation, the bureaucrats' control of the private \nsector \"appears to have been strengthened.\" \n\n   Major economic organizations are very critical of MITI's \n\"interference\" concerning comments by their leaders on government \neconomic policies, according to the 15 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN \n(NIKKEI).  MITI reportedly faxed a memorandum summarizing the \n\"important points\" of the latest government economic stimulus \npackage and \"model comments\" to the offices of four leading private \nsector economic organizations--the Federation of Economic \nOrganizations (Keidanren); the Japanese Association of Corporate \nExecutives (Keizai Doyukai); the Japan Federation of Employers' \nAssociation (Nikkeiren); and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry--on the afternoon of 8 February, a few hours before the \nHosokawa Cabinet approved the stimulus package.  The fax reportedly \nemphasized the \"importance\" of \"praising measures like the income \ntax cut\" and \"supporting the government's policy\" of cutting direct \ntaxes and increasing indirect taxes.  According to the NIKKEI \narticle, the \"model comments\" for use by the heads of the four \neconomic organizations included:  \"We highly praise the courageous \ndecisions of the government and coalition to include an income tax \ncut in the stimulus package.\" \n\n   Although MITI defended its action with the assertion that it \nnever intended to force\" the organizations to use MITI's comments, \nNIKKEI reports that the economic organizations are \"annoyed\" by the \nfax, which \"sounded like an order\" for them to use MITI's comments. \nThe article notes that \"this is the first instance\" of MITI actually \nsending a document instructing the economic organizations what to \nsay, although in the past MITI telephoned them to request that they \nmake comments \"favorable\" to MITI. \n\n   According to a \"source connected with an economic organization\" \ncited by NIKKEI, \"bureaucratic interference\" concerning comments by \nleaders of the economic organizations \"assumed prominence\" in \nDecember 1993, when Jiro Saito, Ministry of Finance vice minister, \nand Hideaki Kumano, MITI vice minister, visited the four \norganizations to \"explain\" the government's policy of income tax \ncuts to be paid for by increases in the consumption tax. \n\n   Editorial Blasts Fax as Example of MITI's 'Excessive Guidance' - \nNIKKEI's 15 February editorial, which is headlined \"Appalled by \nMITI's Excessive Guidance,\" is very critical of MITI, noting that \nits fax \"reminds us of an 'education mama' teaching a two-year-old \nwith simple words.\"  However, it observes, \"the postwar period, in \nwhich Japanese industries were rebuilt under strong MITI guidance, \nhas already ended.\"  \"MITI's excessive guidance,\" the editorial \ncontinues, is an \"extreme anachronism.\"  \"MITI may think that it can \nfreely control private economic organizations with its guidance, but \nsuch presumptuousness is no longer acceptable.\"  The editorial urges \nMITI to \"realize that excessive guidance is now one of the causes \nhindering the vitality of Japanese industries.\" \n\n   The editorial also points out that MITI's fax \"may be cited by \nthe U.S. Government\" to prove its assertion that \"bureaucrats \ncontrol the Japanese economy.\"  It notes that during the recent \nJapan-U.S. framework talks, the U.S. Government criticized Japanese \nbureaucrats for \"controlling the Japanese economy and hindering \nderegulation.\" \n\n   The editorial concludes that it is \"quite ironic\" that under the \nHosokawa administration, which advocates deregulation, bureaucrats \n\"are gaining more power\" and their control of the private sector \n\"appears to have been strengthened.\"  The editorial demands that \nMITI \"reflect gravely on its conduct.\" \n\n   Environmental Issues - Thirty Small Industrial Waste Companies \nForm Cooperative -- About 30 small-scale manufacturers of industrial \nwaste treatment equipment and industrial waste disposal companies \nfrom the Tokyo Metropolitan Area and Nagano, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka \nPrefectures have joined together to form a cooperative association \nwhich will pursue contracts for building final industrial waste \ndisposal facilities and conducting R and D activities.  The \n\"Cooperative Association for Promoting Environment-Related \nEnterprises\" will be established with an investment of 10 million \nyen ($96,000) and will be chaired by Yoshinori Ito, president of \nKankyo Seibi Shinko, an environmental equipment firm. \n\n   The companies decided to form this \"unique\" cooperative because \nas independent firms, each has limited financial resources and thus \ncan not qualify for special programs sponsored by public \ncorporations, such as the Japan Environment Corporation, to finance \nwork for improving disposal facilities to conform with stricter \nenvironmental regulations.  The cooperative plans to expand its \nmembership to about 1,000 companies and establish a network of \nbranch chapters throughout the country.  (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN \n17 Feb 94 p 12) \n\n   Financial Issues - Nippon Credit Bank Expanding, Introducing U.S. \nTechniques -- Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), the newest and smallest of \nJapan's three long-term credit banks, has established a wholly-owned \ntrust banking subsidiary that will begin operations in April 1994, \naccording to the 1 March NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN.  It will be the \nseventh financial institution, after the \"big four\" securities \ncompanies and two banks, to enter the trust banking business through \na financial subsidiary.  Capitalized at 5 billion yen ($48 million) \nand with 15 employees, the new subsidiary will begin buying real- \nestate trusts and bank loans for resale. \n\n   NCB also established a \"financial development division\" within \nits Planning Department in February to engage in real-estate project \nfinance and asset securitization, according to the 18 February \nNIKKEI KINYU.  The new division will offer advice to customers on \nhow to securitize their assets through trust banking or by setting \nup special-purpose companies, and will introduce the securitized \nproducts to its large bank bond purchasing customers.  For now the \ndivision will focus on assisting in the securitization of a \ncustomer's better assets, but in the future it will expand to \nnonperforming loans, as is done by U.S. investment banks. \n\n   Establishing the new division is NCB's first step in expanding \ncommission-earning operations that fully exploit the financial \nengineering techniques used by U.S. investment banks.  The new \ndivision will work in concert with NCB's new trust bank subsidiary \nin promoting business.  By bringing its customers financial \nengineering techniques from the United States, \"smooth fund-raising \nwill become possible\" for real estate  financing. \n\n   In addition, NCB is also building up its system of developing new \nderivative products, such as options, futures and swaps, by \nestablishing a product-development team, according to the 25 \nFebruary NIKKEI KINYU.  The team's objective is to facilitate \nproduct development by addressing the need of institutional \ninvestors and average companies to hedge against interest rate and \ncurrency risks.  The team will be located at NCB's interest-rate \nswap trading desk, the first time a long-term credit bank has set up \na product-development team at a trading desk.  Product development \nand marketing will be streamlined, with a single person in charge of \nboth. This official will concentrate on developing products for the \nportfolio management of manufacturers, not Just securities and \ninsurance companies. \n\n   Although many banks separate their dealing sites and development \ndivisions, product development is easier at a trading desk because \nthere dealers can collect the hedging know-how of major commercial \nand foreign banks.  NCB expects to be able to reduce the time it \ntakes to develop a product, such as swap-related products, from \ndesign to completion in half the time this took previously.  NCB \nplans to sell these products not only to institutional investors but \nalso to average companies. \n\n   Banks Considering Establishment of Offices in Hanoi - Several \nJapanese commercial banks are considering opening offices in Hanoi. \nThe Bank of Tokyo, Sakura Bank, Fuji Bank, Tokai Bank, and Daiwa \nBank, which have already opened representative offices in Ho Chi \nMinh City, have also begun looking into opening offices in Hanoi, \nVietnam's financial administration center.  These banks are expected \nto set up operations in Hanoi \"in the next two or three years\" in \nresponse to the growing number of foreign banks opening offices in \nboth cities.  Sanwa and Sumitomo banks, which are planning to open \nrepresentative offices in Ho Chi Minh City in the spring of 1994, \nare expected to join the others in establishing Hanoi offices in the \nfuture. \n\n   The banks are considering several ways of establishing bases in \nHanoi, including establishing representative offices, local offices, \nor liaison offices of their Ho Chi Minh City representative offices. \nOf the 30 or more non-Japanese foreign banks that have begun \noperations in Vietnam, roughly one-third have bases in both cities \nin the form of a branch offices, representative offices, or local \noffices.  (Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN 16 Feb 94 p 2) \n\n   Former MOF Officials May Become Next BOJ Governor, Stock Exchange \nHead - Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, president of the Export-Import Bank of \nJapan (Ex-Im Bank), who entered the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in \n1951 and rose to  become vice minister in 1984, is rumored to be the \nprobable candidate to succeed Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasushi \nMieno in December 1994 when Mieno's term ends.  In recent years the \nBOJ governorship has alternated between former MOF vice ministers \nand BOJ \"careerists.\"  Since Mieno is a BOJ careerist, the next \ngovernor is likely to be a former MOF vice minister.  Although \nappointing the BOJ governor is the prerogative of the prime \nminister, the incumbent MOF vice minister customarily recommends a \ncandidate to the prime minister, who \"almost automatically \napproves.\" \n\n   Although Yamaguchi is rumored to be the probable candidate, the \nMOF, BOJ and banking industry officials \"are not completely sure \nyet.\"  They question whether the Hosokawa administration will last \nuntil December, when Mieno steps down, and if Prime Minister \nMorihiro Hosokawa's \"advocacy of reforms\" might lead to changes in \nthe selection process.  There have been several instances in the \npast where the personal desires of prime ministers altered the \nselection process.  One example was Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira's \nselection of Haruo Maekawa, then vice president of the Ex-Im Bank, \nover MOF candidate Satoshi Sumita, president of the Ex-Im Bank at \nthat time.  As a result, Sumita had to wait for five years before \ngetting his chance. \n\n   BOJ officials have been resistant to the custom whereby every \nsecond BOJ governor is a former MOF vice minister.  A senior BOJ \nofficial is quoted as saying that the BOJ governor needs to have a \n\"sustainable and medium-term viewpoint\" of the economy and be strong \nenough to implement monetary policies from such a viewpoint, \n\"regardless of what the public at large may say,\" implying that \nbeing a former MOF vice minister in itself is not a sufficient \nqualification to be BOJ governor.  Some banking industry officials \nare also concerned that former MOF bureaucrats tend to compromise \ntoo easily with politicians.  They are also concerned that former \nMOF officials tend to adhere to MOF--not BOJ--\"priorities\" and \nsubject monetary policy to the MOF's fiscal objectives. \nYoshino Rumored To Be Next TSE Board Chairman - Yoshihiko \nYoshino, president of the Japan Development Bank, who entered the \nMOF in 1953 and became vice minister in 1986, most likely will \nsucceed Minoru Nagaoka, chairman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) \nBoard of Directors, when Nagaoka steps down in May.  The \nchairmanship has been filled by former MOP vice ministers since \n1965, when the TSE invited former MOF vice minister Teiichiro \nMorinaga to restore financial health to the securities industry \nfollowing the so-called \"securities recession\" of the mid-1960's. \nSince likely candidates from within the securities industry have \nbeen tainted by the stock-loss compensation scandals of 1991, it is \nhighly likely that a former MOF vice minister will become the next \nTSE chairman.  Nagaoka has been quoted as saying that since current \nMOF Vice Minister Jiro Saito \"plans and decides personnel moves of \nall former MOF bureaucrats,\" Saito will select a candidate from \namong the available former MOF vice ministers.  Then, the candidate \nwill be nominated by the TSE Board of Directors and officially \nelected by two-thirds of all TSE members. \n\n   Within the securities industry, however, there is strong \nresistance to the chairmanship becoming a \"reserved seat\" for former \nMOF vice ministers.  The president of a major securities house \nstates that \"the securities industry is now capable of voluntarily \npromoting fairness and transparency in the stock market,\" so that \nthe industry \"no longer needs influential MOF retirees.\"  Another \nreason for the strong resistance is that the securities industry was \nnot happy with Nagaoka, who, in the industry's view, \"adopted the \nMOF's position,\" rather than representing the securities industry, \nduring the series of securities scandals that began in 1991.  This \nviewpoint was particularly evident concerning the issue of \nestablishing a securities industry watchdog organization.  Nagaoka \nsupported the MOF's idea of establishing the Securities Exchange \nSurveillance Commission within the MOF, instead of an independent \norganization similar to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \nwhich the industry sought.  (Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN 17 Feb 94 p 11) \n\n   MOF To Require Disclosure of 'Off-Balance Sheet' Transactions - \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) has decided to require financial \ninstitutions to disclose information on the status of their so- \ncalled \"off-balance sheet\" transactions.  The MOF has determined \nthat the nontransparency of financial transactions not currently \nincluded in a financial institution's balance sheet--so-called \"off- \nbalance sheet\" transactions,\" such as unlisted futures, swaps, and \noptions--and the concomitant risk of such transactions can cause \nenormous instability to the Japanese financial system as a whole. \nConsequently the MOF will reconvene its special advisory panel in \nMarch to study the issue in detail. \n\n   \"Off-balance sheet\" transactions use cutting-edge financial \nengineering techniques to allow financial institutions to hedge \nagainst risk.  Compared to more traditional financial instruments \nsuch as loans, off-balance-sheet transactions are conducive to \nlarge-volume trading across national borders and have a \ndestabilizing effect internationally when a contract default occurs. \nOverseas off-balance-sheet transactions of Japanese financial \ninstitutions are said to be ballooning, which is one reason why the \nBank for International Settlements (BIS) is calling for their \nthorough disclosure and methods of managing the concomitant risks. \n\n   Some of the issues the MOF advisory committee, \"The Working \nSubcommittee on Financial Institution Disclosure,\" will consider \nare:  whether it can establish a means for market-value assessment \nof unlisted \"off-balance-sheet\" financial products; whether risk \nassessment of all counterparts to off-balance-sheet transactions and \ncomprehensive risk assessment are possible; whether overseas \ntransactions are to be disclosed as well; and whether there is a \nmethod to demonstrate risk management methods that financial \ninstitutions are already using.

In early 1993, the Shanghai municipal \ngovernment set its export target at $7.34 billion, but by mid-year \nonly 45 percent of the target had been fulfilled.  In June, a \nmunicipal economic and trade conference was held to further reform \nand to create an environment more compatible with a socialist market \neconomy.  After administrative protection and preferential policies \nwere abolished, foreign trade enterprises were forced into market \ncompetition.  Last year, foreign trade privileges were also granted \nto an additional 4,000 or so industrial units, research institutes, \nenterprises, and joint venture firms, bringing Shanghai's trading \nentities to approximately 7,000.  Meanwhile, all relevant government \nwork units were instructed to support exports and to launch \ncoordinated measures.  After concerted efforts, exports began to \nincrease and eventually exceeded the 1993 target. \n\n   Future export growth is targeted at 15.4 percent annually.  Since \nthe state abandoned the mandatory export plan and foreign exchange \nsubmitting quota, relevant export promoting measures, including \ntransforming the operational mechanism of trade offices, providing \nincentives, and adjusting industrial production, should be \ninstituted as soon as possible.

The surviving companies are at \"high risk\" \nof closing down as well, if current conditions prevail, the reports \nsay. \n\n   Since 1984, when joint venture laws were enacted in North Korea, \nChosen Soren and the DPRK have established about 120 joint-venture \ncompanies which account for over 60 percent of the total number of \nDPRK joint ventures, according to the 13 January Seoul NAEWOE \nTONGSIN.  The 25 January Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN, citing the ROK \nNational Unification Board's recent report to the National Assembly, \nstates that since 1990, most of the North Korean joint ventures with \nChosen Soren have closed down and only 20 some companies--out of \nmore than 120--are currently in business.  Moreover, if the DPRK \nmaintains its \"excessive regulations\" and \"closed-door policy,\" the \nremaining joint ventures run the risk of going bankrupt as well, the \npaper asserts. \n\n   NAEWOE notes that, according to Chon Chin-sik, president of \nMoranbong Joint Venture Co. (one of the major DPRK-Chosen Soren \njoint-venture companies), as relations between Japan and the DPRK \nimproved following former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru's \nvisit to Pyongyang in September 1990, North Korea moved from mainly \ndealing with Chosen Soren to attempting to \"recruit\" Japanese \ncompanies for joint venture projects.  Chon said that during this \nperiod, North Korea \"ignored\" Chosen Soren joint-venture companies. \n\n   Moreover, after the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in March 1993, it put \"tight\" \nrestrictions on foreign visitors, including Koreans associated with \nChosen Soren, and Japanese experts who were to advise the joint- \nventure factories on technical matters, NAEWOE reports.  In \naddition, the energy shortage in North Korea has had an impact on \nChosen Soren joint ventures as well.  HANGYORE points out that North \nKorea has been giving preferential treatment to domestic companies \nwhich received their supply of electricity before Chosen Soren \njoint-venture companies.  Furthermore, North Korea has often \nexported substandard goods, causing a loss of credibility for the \njoint ventures and eliciting claims against them, according to \nHANGYORE.  For example, a large quantity of poorly made suits \nmanufactured by Moranbong Joint Venture Co. was found at customs \nclearance in Japan last October, NAEWOE says. \n\n   NAEWOE cites additional reasons behind the difficulties \nexperienced by the joint-venture companies, such as North Korea's \nviolations of contract provisions,  excessive regulations,\" multiple \ninspections, and bribery.  North Korea has reportedly marketed goods \nin places that were not stipulated under existing agreements, such \nas Macao and Hong Kong, in order to obtain a better profit margin. \nNAEWOE reports that Chosen Soren \"strongly protested\" against such \nconduct in 1989 at the 4th annual meeting of Korea International \nJoint Venture Union Co.'s board of directors, which is responsible \nfor coordinating and giving guidance to DPEK-Chosen Soren joint- \nventure projects.  The board's yearly meeting, whose purpose is to \nset guidelines for upcoming joint-venture activities, has not been \nheld since November 1992, NAEWOE notes. \n\n   SOUTH KOREA:  FEATURE:  Patent Office Looks for Countermeasures \nto Patent Disputes -- SUMMARY:  According to recent Seoul press \nreports, the number of ROK patent applications is growing, as is the \nnumber of patent disputes that ROK firms face.  Yet most firms pay \nscant attention to issues of patents and technology protection. \nRecently, the Office of Patent Administration has started setting up \npatent technology councils to foster cooperation among ROK firms and \nhelp counterbalance patent disputes.  In addition, it has held an \nopen forum to discuss reforming the patent judgment system. \n\n   According to an article in the 9 February CHUGAN MAEGYONG, there \nare four ways to protect ideas using the ROK legal system:  by \nregistering patents, utility models, designs, or trademarks.  It \ntakes an average of 32 to 34 months to screen a patent or utility \nmodel application.  While South Korea ranks sixth in the world in \nthe number of applications filed for patents or utility models, it \nlacks the systematic backing to help commercialize these ideas, \naccording to CHUGAN.  While there are funds available to help cover \nproduction costs for commercializing new ideas, they only amount to \nabout 200 million won ($250,000) annually. \n\n   The 24 January HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN (HKS) publishes data from \nthe Office of Patent Administration showing that South Koreans \napplied for 21,459 patents in 1993, an increase of 34.5 percent over \n1992.  At the same time patent applications by foreigners dropped \n0.6 percent.  ROK citizens' applications for low-tech utility models \ntotaled 31,505, a l2.8-percent increase over 1992, while foreign \napplications fell 3.9 percent.  Design and trademark applications by \nKoreans rose by 20.4 percent and 40.4 percent, respectively. \nIndustrial property rights applications rose 22 percent, to 155,870, \nwith corporations accounting for 57.9 percent of the total. \nAccording to HKS, these increases are not caused by an increased \nawareness of the concept of technology as property, but rather they \nare spurred by the growing number of industrial property disputes \nbetween both domestic and foreign firms. \n\n   The 29 January HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN notes that intellectual \nproperty rights (IPR) disputes are growing in number, and that ROK \nfirms do not have sufficient ability to respond to the problem.  The \nHanbit IPR Center recently surveyed member firms about this issue. \nOf the 153 firms responding, 69.2 percent had been involved in such \ndisputes.  For electronics firms, the percentage was even higher- \n-81.3 percent.  Disputes between ROK firms accounted for 50.5 \npercent of the cases, while disputes with foreign firms accounted \nfor 13.1 percent.  HKS adds that 35.4 percent of the firms had had \ndisputes with both domestic and foreign firms.  With regard to \ndispute resolution, HKS reports that 31.3 percent of disputes were \nresolved in court, with the judge finding for one side or the other, \nwhile 30.3 percent were resolved through compromise.  According to \nHKS, when a dispute involved a foreign firm, ROK firms faced such \ndifficulties as a lack of data or technical information (22 \npercent), insufficient knowledge of foreign laws (14 percent), and \nhigh costs (12 percent). \n\n   Most firms have paid little attention to the issue of patents or \ntechnology protection, reports the 15 January HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN. \nAccording to statistics from the Office of Patent Administration, \n749 manufacturers, or slightly more than 1 percent of all \nmanufacturing firms, have set up offices to deal with patent issues. \nOf these, more than 96 percent employ fewer than five workers in \ntheir patent office.  However, some of the larger firms are devoting \nresources to this area, HKS notes.  Samsung Electronics has a 130- \nmember IPR team, Goldstar has a 43-member intellectual property \nmanagement office, and Daewoo Electronics, Goldstar Electron, and \nHyundai Electronics are all expanding their patent-related offices. \nHKS comments that the most \"anxious\" organizations within \nelectronics firms are those responsible for industrial property \nrights.  Firms must control their technology through patents, the \npaper suggests, and patent experts, who are scarce, should be \nquickly trained.  HKS also notes by cooperating on technology \ndevelopment, firms might reduce the burden of industrial property \nrights disputes. \n\n   There are already moves towards cooperation on a larger scale. \nAccording to the 4 February MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN (MKS), \"patent \ntechnology councils\" are becoming active in high-tech areas.  These \ncouncils enable firms to share reciprocal licenses or patent rights. \nMKS reports that the Office of Patent Administration is considering \ncooperative \"countermeasures\" to international patent disputes and \nthe rise in foreign countries \"patent aggression,\" and this year \nwill set up three new patent technology councils--for computers, \nelectric ranges, and construction.  At the end of 1993 it set up \nnine councils, covering washing machines, electronic circuits, \nantibiotics, synthetic textiles, PVC processing technologies, \norganic and inorganic chemistry, waste disposal technology for steel \nproducers, and CFC substitutes.  The patent administration believes \nthat these councils could indirectly aid firms in technology \ndevelopment by supplying information on leading edge technologies. \nMKS predicts that as these councils become more active, cross- \nlicensing agreements will flourish.  Another measure which would \npromote technological cooperation--a proposal to grant tax benefits \nto firms that have concluded cross-licensing agreements--is under \nconsideration, according to MKS. \n\n   On the legal front, there are voices calling for establishing a \n\"patent court,\" reports the 25 January HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN.  On 24 \nJanuary, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a public \nforum on the issue of revising the patent judgment system.  At the \nmeeting, representatives from business and technology circles \ndemanded the establishment of a patent court that includes judges \nwho are technical experts.  (According to the 25 January MAEIL \nKYONGJE SINMUN, currently the Office of Patent Administration \nhandles an initial patent dispute trial and the first appeal, if \nany.  If those involved in the case still disagree with the ruling, \nthey may appeal to the Supreme Court for a third trial.)  Industrial \ncircles question the cost, timeliness, and courts' ability to make \ntechnical judgments under the current system; they recommend setting \nup a patent court.  One industry representative emphasized that in \npatent judgments a factual trial is more important than a legal \nanalysis.  HKS reports that patent attorneys oppose letting the \npatent office handle the first and second trials, and suggest \nestablishing a patent court composed of both technical and legal \njudges.  Legal circles also oppose the patent office's role, \nmaintaining that it is unconstitutional.  According to HKS, this \ngroup would like to see a patent department set up in the Seoul High \nCourt, with the existing court handling matters and bringing in \ntechnical aides and advisory groups.  Finally, the Office of Patent \nAdministration asserts that the current system is legal.  It does, \nhowever, recognize a drop in the quality of judges.  It recommends \nsetting up a patent judgment court within the current framework, and \nraising the number of technical judges to improve the quality of \njudgments. \n\n   FEATURE:  ROK Efforts in Obtaining Foreign Commercial Technology \nChronicled -- SUMMARY:  South Korea is using a variety of methods to \nacquire advanced foreign commercial technology, according to ROK \npress reports.  Recognizing a \"gap\" between the level of technology \nemployed by foreign competitors and what is available domestically \nto ROK manufacturers, industry and government are jointly engaged in \nefforts to compensate by appropriating foreign know-how as the basis \nfor the country's commercial S and T programs. \n\n   Seoul business newspapers recently published several articles \ndescribing efforts by the ROK Government and commercial firms to \npromote economic competitiveness through the use of foreign \ntechnology.  These methods reportedly include using public funds to \nindigenize foreign high-tech, hiring foreigners with technical \nexpertise, collecting technical intelligence through overseas ROK \nsubsidiaries, identifying and recruiting expatriate scientists, \ntechnical \"cooperation\" with foreign companies, and exploiting cash- \nstrapped Russian firms for patented technology (see related article \nin PACIFIC RIM ECONOMIC REVIEW Vol 2 No 20, 6 Oct 93 pp 24-26). \n\n   The number of cases listed would increase significantly if \nreports of technical agreements, licensed production of foreign \nproducts, buyouts of foreign firms, \"indigenized\" products, new \noverseas \"research\" facilities, and other types of scientific \n\"exchanges\" (where the transfer or appropriation of foreign \ntechnology is implied) were also included.  The picture that emerges \nthrough ROK press reporting in recent months on South Korea's \nintensified quest for technology is that of a country striving to \nclose the \"gap\" with \"advanced countries\" more through imitation \nthan innovation.  This is reflected in the ROK press' habitual use \nof verbs such as \"acquire,\" \"accumulate,\" and \"indigenize,\" while \nthe term \"develop\" is usually restricted to broad technologies with \nlittle specific content or to ROK efforts to reinvent existing \nproducts, and the word \"create\" simply does not appear. \n\n   South Korea To 'Develop' Laser Disk Drive - The ROK Government \nand domestic computer manufacturers will jointly develop a laser \ndisk drive for use with peripheral equipment in next-generation \ncomputers.  Work began in December 1993 with a 370-million won \n($462,500) grant from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy \n(MOTIE) to the Korea Computer Research Association, which is \nmanaging the project with Goldstar's and Hyundai Electronics' \nparticipation.  The drive will be ready for domestic use and export \nby 1997. \n\n   Goldstar has on hand laser disk drive technology which it \nimported from Japan in 1990.  Hyundai, for its part, obtained \"world \nstandard\" technology from its buyout of the U.S. electronics firm \nMaxter, and claims  we won't have much trouble developing it.\"  The \nproject is also expected to give a big boost to domestic \nmanufacturers of recording equipment that uses laser disk \ntechnology, and could lead to \"indigenizing\" all parts connected \nwith computer memory devices.

Even mid-size \nfirms are discovering they can defeat \"barricades to technology\" \nerected by another country by hiring that country's nationals, \ndirectly or through overseas subsidiaries.  The latter are sent to \nSouth Korea periodically \"to solve problems that occur on production \nlines and for technical consultations.\"  The strategy of hiring \nforeigners with technical skills to improve the competitiveness of \nROK products is likened to \"using barbarians to control barbarians.\" \n(Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN 8 Feb 94 p 14) \n\n   U.S.-Based Subsidiaries Collecting Technical Information - ROK \nfactory automation (FA) companies are busily setting up subsidiaries \nabroad to open up new markets for their products, and to \"beef up \ntheir collection of technical information.\"  Poscon's new subsidiary \nin Delaware, Poscon International Corporation (PIC), will attempt to \nmarket its own FA products in the United States while it \"engages in \ntechnical information collection activities.\"  Samsung Aerospace \nwill form two \"teams\" this year for FA equipment exports and control \nequipment exports, while stepping up activities at its U.S. \nsubsidiary Samsung Optical America (SOA).

At least one ROK firm is seeking to apply \nplasma display technology to \"multivision\" TV's with screens more \nthan eight feet wide.  The industry regards these products as \n\"transitional\" steps on the way to high-definition equipment now \nbeing developed. \n\n   South Korean electronics manufacturers are turning their \nattention to large screen color televisions in response to \nincreasing demand for upscale commercial appliances both \ndomestically and abroad.  According to the 9-16 February CHUGAN \nMAEGYONG, large color TV's held 5 percent of the ROK market in 1990, \n11 percent in 1991, 21 percent in 1992, and 27 percent last year (35 \npercent by value).  At present, the most popular models are 25-inch \nsets which have 70 percent of the large screen market, 29-inch with \n25 percent of the market, and 33-inch with 4 percent.  A small \nnumber of homes have 42-inch and 46-inch projection TV's, the \nmagazine reports. \n\n   These units, whose verticle-to-horizontal dimensions have a fixed \nratio of 3:4, differ from the widescreen color TV's just now being \nmarketed which are proportionately wider and based on different \ntechnology.  According to the 9 January MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN (MKS), \nSouth Korea's first domestic widescreen television--a 36-inch model- \n-was introduced in February 1993 by Goldstar.  A follow-up model \nwith a 32-inch screen that can project as many as four pictures on \nthe same screen (picture-in-picture or PIP) came out at the end of \nlast year.  Goldstar expects 1994 sales of the two models to reach \n2,000 and 6,000 sets, respectively.  Samsung Electronics recently \nintroduced its own 32-inch widescreen model with PIP and \nstereophonic sound, and is bringing out a 28-inch model later in \n1994.  Total sales are expected to pass 10,000.  Daewoo and Anam \nreportedly will market competitive products shortly. \n\n   Meanwhile, the 11 January MKS reports that Samsung Electron \nDevices has made South Korea the \"second country after Japan\" to \ndevelop a flat cathode ray tube for widescreen TV.  The company \nspent one year and 5 billion won ($6.25 million) \"indigenizing\" the \npart which will be used in 32-inch screens.  The tube reportedly is \n\"twice as flat\" as existing models.  It uses a 32.5 mm electron gun \n(down from 37.5 mm) and Samsung's \"double dynamic focus\" system to \nproduce clear pictures.  The newspaper reports the tube will be used \nin widescreen televisions just now being produced in South Korea, \nand in the high-definition television (HDTV) sets of the future. \nThe 9 January MKS states that the ROK electronics industry views \nwidescreen TV as a \"transitional by-product\" of HDTV, which is \nexpected to \"dominate\" the market by the year 2000. \n\n   In a related development, the 10 February Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO \nreports that Orion Electronics, a subsidiary of the Daewoo Group, \nhas established a joint venture with Russia's Gas Discharge \nEquipment Research Lab (under the jurisdiction of Russia's Munitions \nIndustrial Committee) to produce plasma display panels (PDP's).  The \nequipment, originally produced for Russia's aerospace program, \nreportedly is being designed for use with extra large \n(\"multivision\") televisions with 100-inch plus displays.  According \nto the newspaper, PDP's are much narrower than conventional cathode \nray tubes, and offer a brighter screen than liquid crystal displays \n(LCD's).  The new company, Orion Plasma Research and Production, \nwill be located southeast of Moscow.  Each partner will supply half \nof the $4-million capital. \n\n   Government Committee Devising NAFTA Countermeasures - On 24 \nJanuary, the ROK Government's \"NAFTA Countermeasures Committee\" \nconsisting of 17 members from trade-related agencies and industry \nmet to discuss a \"new strategy\" that entails increasing local \ninvestment, moving \"full-scale\" into the U.S. distribution market, \nrelying on trade diplomacy, and strengthening industrial \ntechnological \"cooperation.\"  The committee agreed that plans to \nsecure a share of the North American market will be frustrated \nunless accompanied by direct local investment.  In those sectors \nwhere South Korean exports lose their competitiveness to Mexican \ngoods which enter the United States duty free, South Korea will \nreact by reducing distribution expenses through more aggressive \nexport marketing.  A fact-finding team will be sent to the United \nStates in the first half of 1994 to survey the distribution market, \nwhile ROK companies are encouraged to participate in U.S. trade \nexhibitions and make other efforts to find local vendors. \nCompetitiveness of South Korean products will also be enhanced by \nstrengthening technological \"cooperation\" through the ROK-U.S. \nIndustrial Cooperation Foundation.  In terms of diplomacy, South \nKorea will use the Uruguay Round and bilateral trade negotiating \nforums to check NAFTA's \"excessive discrimination\" against non- \nmember countries as evidenced, for example, in its stringent \ncountry-of-origin criteria.  The committee plans to have a \"full- \nblown NAFTA strategy\" ready by March this year.

Also, Japan continuously shifts \nits overseas sites depending on the manufacturing cost and the \n\"technological level of the product targeted for investment\" so that \nno country obtains more technology than what it already has. \n\n   Conversely, the study notes that ROK firms appreciate less the \nneed to keep technology out of other countries' hands, and are \nconcerned only with raising productivity at the overseas site.  It \nadds that South Korean companies take high risks, by Japanese \nstandards, in moving production to countries such as China, Vietnam, \nand Burma without making a full analysis of the situation and with \nno means to deal with unfavorable changes that may develop.  Japan's \nability to keep high technology at home and diversify its overseas \nlabor sites effectively \"squeezes\" ROK firms which are adept at \ndoing neither.

Sumitro's analysis of the economic situation, as \nreported in BISNIS INDONESIA, KOMPAS, SUARA PEMBARUAN, and MERDEKA, \nis based on a \"capital-output ratio,\" using quantitative and \nempirical data, as well as statistical figures from the Central \nBureau of Statistics.  Sumitro's conclusion is that Indonesia's \neconomic development has been \"less efficient and less effective\" \ncompared with other ASEAN countries whose economies are \n\"structurally similar.\"  The papers also note that Sumitro \nattributes this \"undesirable situation\" to the \"large amounts of \nwaste and losses,\" caused by mismanagement; investments in \ninfrastructure that have slow or little yield; \"incompetence\" in \nplanning, operating, and maintaining investment projects; and \n\"irregularities\" such as graft. \n\n   BISNIS INDONESIA reports that during Indonesia's fifth Five-Year \nDevelopment Plan (1989-1994), public and private investments \namounted to 33.4 percent of the national income, with annual \neconomic growth at 6.8 percent.  Based on these figures, the \nincremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) is 33.4 : 6.8 = 4.9 or 5. \nThis ICOR, Sumitro points out, is \"somewhat high\" compared to the \nratios for other ASEAN countries, which generally range from 3 to \n3.5.  Sumitro suggests that a reduction in the cost of the economy \nwill ultimately result in Indonesia's becoming more competitive \nabroad and in a higher economic growth for the country; he adds that \nif the ICOR during the second stage of Indonesia's long-term \ndevelopment cycle could be reduced to 3.5, and if investments remain \nat 33.4 percent of national income, Indonesia could achieve an \nannual growth of 9.5 percent (33.4 : 3.5). \n\n   Sumitro's assessment of the country's economic situation \ncoincides with that of Rizal Ramly, executive director of the \neconomic, industrial, and trade consulting firm Ekonit.  According \nto a 23 January KOMPAS editorial, Rizal believes that new measures \nto directly address Indonesia's high cost economy should be worked \nout and implemented in order to improve the country's \ncompetitiveness in overseas markets. \n\n   Economists Priasmoro Prawiroardjo and Hadi Soesastro of the \nCenter for Strategic and International Studies share Rizal's view \nthat a new set of deregulation policies is deeded.  According to the \n22 January KOMPAS, Hadi believes that improving the business climate \nwould play an important role in stimulating overall economic \nactivity and in improving efficiency in the industrial sector, while \nPriasmoro views production efficiency as the key problem that \nIndonesian exporters must overcome to penetrate the world market. \nPriasmoro stresses that cutting back on production cost alone will \nnot be enough and that improved macroeconomic conditions are also \nnecessary.  Moreover, he asserts that implementation of the \nagreements reached at the Uruguay Round will pose more challenges \nthan opportunities to the Indonesian industrial sector.  He also \npoints out that Indonesia's electronic industrialists are already \nconcerned about the competition that will come from AFTA (Asean Free \nTrade Area).  They fear that under the Common Effective Preferential \nTariff (CEPT) plan of AFTA, the market will be saturated with \nelectronic products from Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.  And \nbecause of the time-consuming procedures and \"unpredictable costs\" \nassociated with investing in Indonesia (such as \"illegal levies\" \nthat have to be paid to obtain business licenses), these \nindustrialists predict that other Indonesian products have little \nchance of getting a share of the international market, KOMPAS \nreports. \n\n   FEATURE:  Workers Strike as Government Enforces Minimum Wage \nDecree -- SUMMARY:  Several Jakarta newspapers report that thousands \nof employees went on strike recently to demand better treatment by \ntheir employers and an increase to the $2 daily minimum wage \nrecently set by the government for Jakarta and its surrounding \nareas. \n\n   The 4 February ANGKATAN BERSENJATA and SUARA PEMBARUAN report \nthat thousands of employees of several companies in the Tangerang \narea went on strike three weeks after a ministerial decree on an \nincrease in daily minimum wage went into effect on 1 January.  The \nstrikes occurred after employers turned down the employees' demand \nfor a 26-percent increase in the daily minimum wage--which is \napproximately $2--set by the government.  In Bekasi, 30 km east of \nJakarta, 1,200 workers from five companies went on strike early last \nweek, according to the 7 February ANGKATAN BERSENJATA.  In addition \nto a salary increase, workers demanded that companies grant them \nbetter benefits and special allowances.  The paper also states that \nreports from Bandung indicate that hundreds of employees went on \nstrike for the same reasons as their counterparts in Bekasi, while \nhundreds of workers from Bogor demonstrated in front of the Ministry \nof Manpower.  The demonstration prompted a government investigation \ninto allegations that employers are violating the minimum wage \nregulations, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA says. \n\n   SUARA PEMBARUAN notes that most employers have proposed that the \ndecree enforcement be postponed until April, citing the need for \nmore time to adjust their payrolls, not only in connection with the \nwage hike but also for the annual \"Lebaran\" (festivities at the end \nof the fasting month) bonus in March.  The paper also quotes \nTangerang Regent Saifullah Abdulrahman who said that out of 870 \ncompanies in the region, at least 80 small and medium firms cannot \nafford to pay their workers a daily minimum wage of $2.  Saifullah \nstated that some of the firms have even filed a protest to the \nMinistry of Manpower and have enclosed their financial statements. \nHowever, the paper continues, Manpower Minister Abdul Latief has \nstated that based on the outcome of a recent survey on cost \nstructure, companies are in fact capable of and should be paying \ntheir workers more.  Latief said that labor cost averages only 9.8 \npercent of total production cost, which is \"too small.\"  He also \nasserted that, according to the All-Indonesia Labor Union (SPSI), \nsome companies in the shoe industry have spent only 2 percent of \ntheir total operational budget on labor.  SPSI General Secretary \nBomer Pasaribu attributes this \"deplorable situation\" to the fact \nthat employers have always regarded wages as part of production \ncost, subject to reduction, and hence wages have always been \nsuppressed. \n\n   Minister Latief warns businesses that more strikes will occur \nprior to Lebaran, unless employers become more responsive to \nworkers' demand for better pay and better benefits, ANGKATAN \nBERSENJATA reports.  The paper also quotes Aburizal Bakrie, chairman \nof the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who called on \nall employers to willingly comply with the minimum wage regulation. \nBakrie said that \"workers are assets, not production tools,\" and \nthat the minimum wage is set at \"a low level so companies won't be \nburdened.\" \n\n   According to the 8 February KOMPAS, the government is determined \nto make companies comply with the minimum wage regulation.  The \npaper says that President Suharto has ordered his cabinet ministers \nto make a list of the companies that violate the regulation and/or \noperate without a labor union, and to take the necessary steps \nagainst them.  The president has stated that employers should not be \nconcerned with profits only, but that they must also pay attention \nto the rights and welfare of workers, the paper reports. \n\n   Central Bank Needs $400-Million 'Standby Loan' - The Bank of \nIndonesia (Central Bank) recently announced that Indonesia has \ntasked six international banks to come up with a $400-million \n\"standby loan.\"  The six banks include Banque Nationale de Paris, \nBank of Tokyo in Hong Kong, Chase Manhattan Asia, Dresdner, \nIndustrial Bank of Japan, and Long Term Credit Bank, Asia. \n\n   The seven-year loan will be signed in March, with a utility \nperiod of five years after the loan is signed.

(Bangkok \nRadio Thailand Network 0000 GMT 2 Mar 94) Bangkok Bureau \n\n   VIETNAM:  FEATURE:  Losses in Rice Export Earnings Reported -- \nSUMMARY:  A Hanoi press report notes that Vietnamese rice dealers \nsuffered losses of about $2 million in rice export earnings in \nOctober 1993, mainly because of a shortage of funds and stiff \ncompetition among the dealers.  The same report shows that Vietnam \ncurrently ranks third among world rice exporters and points out the \nneed for changes in the State's management of rice export. \n\n   According to a 22 August 1993 Hanoi VNA report, between 1989 and \n1992, Vietnam exported 5.76 million metric tons of rice worth over \n$1 billion.  The 5 January THOI BAO KINH TE VIET NAM notes that in \nthe last three years, the country has exported a yearly average of \nabout 1.7 million metric tons of rice, which brought in revenues \nthat are second only to earnings from  crude oil export.  The 6-12 \nJanuary TUAN BAO QUOC TE points out that although Vietnam currently \nranks third among world rice exporters, rice dealers have registered \nlosses of about $2 million in October 1993, in exporting more than \n100,000 metric tons of rice. \n\n   TUAN BAO QUOC TE (TBQT) suggests that one of the main reasons for \nthe losses in rice export earnings is the stiff competition between \nrice dealers, resulting in rising domestic purchase prices and \nfalling export prices.  Another reason cited by the newspaper is \npoor management\" by the State.  Despite a government directive to \nreduce the number of principal rice exporters to 17, there were \nstill over 40 exporters in November 1993, since any firm with a \ncontract listing prices commensurate with government prices could \nobtain an export permit, including those who did not have storage \nspace or processing mills. \n   TBQT also cites the shortage of funds used to buy rice as a \nproblem.  Some $200 million were actually required to purchase rice \nin the Mekong River delta, but the largest amount received was only \n$740,000 and the smallest $45,000, while small enterprises received \nonly 10 percent of the funds needed.  According to TBQT, few firms \nwant to sign big contracts and take out loans to buy rice for export \nahead of time, but they will rush out to make rice purchases only \nwhen customers offer letters of credit and ships start to come in. \n\n   TBQT reports that Vietnamese rice export increased from 1.42 \nmillion metric tons in 1989 to 1.95 million metric tons in 1992, and \ntotaled 1.7 million metric tons in 1993.  The number of countries \nwho have signed purchase contracts with Vietnam has also increased \nfrom 24 in 1992 to 50 in 1993.  The quality of the exported rice is \nreportedly improving each year, with an increasingly smaller \npercentage of broken rice.  Currently, prices for Vietnamese rice \nare $50-$60 less per metric ton than Thai rice of the same quality. \n\n   TBQT concludes that to achieve success in rice export, the State \nneeds to improve its management system, strengthen the Union of \nGrain Exporters, and give rice exporters regular guidance on \ndomestic and international trade regulations in order to avoid the \nkind of losses experienced in the last quarter of 1993. \n\n   Government To Approve Foreign Construction of Infrastructure \nProjects - The Vietnamese Government will reportedly prepare \nlegislation to implement a system whereby foreign companies will \nundertake the construction of infrastructural projects on a turnkey, \nor \"build, operate, and transfer\" (BOT) basis.  This \"BOT-style\" \nsystem involves entrusting all matters concerning infrastructural \nprojects to foreign companies, from financing to construction and \nactual operation.  The government has \"great expectations\" for this \nsystem, since it will not have to provide financing and because \nforeign firms will contribute management and other knowhow to \nVietnam.  China and Southeast Asian countries have successfully used \nthe BOT system to build power-generating facilities and highways. \n\n   In the first half of March, the Vietnam State Committee for \nCooperation and Investment (SCCI) plans to hold a \"forum on BOT- \nstyle investment\" in Hanoi for foreign financial organs and \ndevelopment companies.  At that time the SCCI will announce \nregulations concerning BOT bidding and contracting. \n\n   However, there have been \"many problems\" with the BOT system \ninvolving contracts let by government agencies and the companies \nsigning them, as exemplified by the recent withdrawal of Japanese \ncompanies from an expressway construction project in Thailand.  In \nVietnam's case, there probably will be difficulties over the long \nterm in collecting fees from completed generating plants, highways, \nand bridges.  And even if some financing consortiums are formed, \nthey will adopt a \"cautious stance\" regarding involvement in \nVietnam.  It appears that initially, banks controlled by overseas \nChinese and French banks will be the main participants in financing \nconsortiums.  (Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN 24 Feb 94 p 2) \n\n   Government To Develop 'Core' Groups of State Enterprises - \nAccording to an article in the 19 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN by \nMakoto Suzuki, the paper's Hanoi correspondent, the Vietnamese \nGovernment has decided to make the development of \"core enterprise \ngroups\" from among major state enterprises a \"pillar\" of its \neconomic restructuring program.  Although the government has been \nmaking efforts to nurture private companies as part of its economic \nreform measures, private companies still remain \"weak.\"  Thus, the \ngovernment's plan is to use selected \"core\" state enterprises as \n\"locomotives\" of economic growth. \n\n   As soon as possible, a list of candidate firms from among \nenterprises currently under the control of government agencies will \nbe presented to Prime Minister Vo Van Khiet.  Then a \"limited \nnumber\" of core groups will be established--more will be designated \nlater--and they will be removed from the control of ministries and \nagencies, \"placed directly under the government,\" run \n\"experimentally,\" and gradually will be expanded. \n\n   Suzuki writes that as explained by Le Xuan Trinh, minister and \ndirector of the Government Office, these core enterprises will be \ndeveloped into \"powerful\" groups with capital levels of \"several \ntrillion\" dong (several hundred million dollars).  Also, each group \nwill have \"several dozen umbrella companies\" under it.  According to \nTrinh, companies under the Energy Ministry and the postal and \ncommunications authorities \"will be the first\" to be transferred. \n\n   Reorganizing state enterprises is one of the government's basic \npolicy goals, Suzuki notes, along with privatization and \nreorganizing loss-making enterprises.  In this process, developing \ncore enterprise groups appears to be a \"precise\" policy of \nselectively developing \"superior\" state enterprises. \n\n   Banking Association To Include Domestic, Foreign Banks - Vietnam \nwill establish a Banking Association by mid-1994 that is expected to \nbring together various domestic financial institutions as well as \nforeign banks operating in Vietnam.  The government intends to use \ntheir views in modernizing Vietnam's financial system. \n\n   There are four types of financial institutions in Vietnam, in \naddition to Vietnam's State Bank--state-owned commercial banks, \nprivate joint-venture banks, credit cooperatives, and finance \ncompanies (nonbanks). There are \"more than 20 large and medium-size\" \nstate-owned commercial banks and private joint-venture banks.  About \n40 domestic financial organizations intend to join the association. \nAs for foreign banks, there are more than 30 operating in Vietnam \nthrough branches, joint ventures, or resident offices. \n\n   Among Japanese banks, Tokyo and Sakura Banks, which already have \nresident offices in Ho Chi Minh City, are expected to join the new \nassociation.  Also, it is anticipated that American banks will \nquickly enter Vietnam now that the economic embargo has been lifted. \nHowever, since foreign banks are \"uneasy\" about doing business in \nVietnam because of the country's undeveloped financial markets, \nJapanese and other foreign banks hope to use the Banking Association \nto propose ways the Vietnamese Government might regulate the \nindustry.

Despite his harsh \nreaction, he appeared to attempt to minimize the damage to U.S.- \nRussian relations.  Nevertheless, his reaction and the initial \ntreatment of the incident by the Russian media suggest that \nMoscow is concerned that the United States may be reevaluating \nits policy toward his administration. \n                           END SUMMARY \n   Yeltsin angrily announced cancellation of his meeting with the \nformer U.S. President on 9 March.  He told reporters that it was \n\"impossible\" for him to meet Richard Nixon after the latter's 8 \nMarch meetings with Rutskoy, recently released from jail under an \namnesty approved by the Russian legislature over Yeltsin's \nopposition, and Communist party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. \nYeltsin stressed that neither he, the government, nor his chief \nof staff--all scheduled to meet with former President Nixon- \n-would now receive him.  Further highlighting his displeasure, \nYeltsin stressed that \"Russia is a great country\" and \"simply \ncannot be trifled with\" (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, (9 March). \n   Yeltsin appeared concerned to limit the damage to relations with \nthe United States while at the same time giving an implicit \nwarning that bilateral relations could be harmed by such \nincidents.  He noted that he was \"impressed\" with the position \ntaken by U.S. President Bill Clinton who he said had phoned him \nand \"distanced himself from [former President] Nixon's trip,\" and \nstressed that the \"U.S.-Russian partnership must be preserved and \ndeveloped\" as a \"great achievement\" that \"we worked very hard for \nand we must not lose\" (ITAR-TASS, 9 March). \n   Similarly, the Russian Foreign Ministry appeared to distance \nitself and the U.S. government from the former president's visit. \nAccording to Interfax, the ministry said that it \"has nothing to \ndo with [former President] Nixon's visit\" and the news agency \nquoted a \"high-ranking\" Russian diplomat as saying that the \nministry \"would have monitored\" the visit \"had the American \nembassy been in charge of it\" (9 March). \n   In contrast, Zyuganov and the Russian Communist Party's press \nservice portrayed the meeting with former President Nixon as a \ndeliberate effort by the U.S. government to broaden its contacts \nwithin Russia.  Claiming that the ex-president's meeting with \nZyuganov will give U.S. officials a more realistic picture of \nwhat is happening in Russia, the press service announced that the \nmeeting \"proves\" that such a \"better understanding\" is what the \nU.S. leadership wants.  Zyuganov himself claimed that the \nCommunists and \"all Russian patriotic movements\" were \"concerned \nover the inflexible U.S. approach to Russian political forces\" \nand \"believed that the growth in anti-American sentiment in \nRussia\" was connected with \"U.S. unconditional support for the \npresent unpopular executive power\" (Interfax, 9 March). \n   Media Coverage \n   Russian media coverage of the visit, as presented on 9 March, \nafter his meeting with Rutskoy, was negative.  ITAR-TASS, citing \n\"competent sources\" on the reasons behind the cancellation of the \ngovernment meetings, said that the former president's initiatives \nhad been seen \"as a sign of disrespect for the political will of \nthe Russian leadership.\"  One Russian television commentary (see \nbox)--describing Rutskoy as a \"recent Lefortovo [prison] inmate\"- \n-linked former President Nixon's meetings with what it claimed \nwas recent U.S. \"maneuvering\" on foreign policy toward Russia and \nwondered \"what's going on in American foreign policy,\" and if \nthere was a \"change of politicial direction\" in Washington \n(Russian TV, 9 March). \n   Implications \n   Yeltsin's angry response to what he portrayed as a personal and \npolitical insult suggests a concern that the United States is \nreevaluating its relationship with Russia and with him \npersonally.  Yeltsin's sharp reaction and the media coverage of \nthe incident so far is consistent with previous Russian reaction \nto what are seen as the U.S. administration's efforts to review \nits policy toward Russia. \n   BOX \n   State-run Russian Television's coverage of former U.S. President \nRichard Nixon's visit to Moscow included what appears to be a \ndeliberate attempt to raise questions about U.S. policy toward \nRussia and dramatize the Yeltsin administration's decision to \ncancel meetings with him. \n   The coverage of the visit on the 1100 GMT newscast on 9 March \nbegan with a commentary on relations between Russia and the \nUnited States which claimed that recent visits to the U.S. by \nUkrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Georgian President Eduard \nShevardnadze had led to agreements with the U.S. that were \n\"revisions\" of agreements previously reached \"with Russian \nparticipation.\"  The commentator, G. Shakhov then turned to the \n\"private\" visit by former President Nixon, noting that the latter \n\"considered it necessary\" to meet the previous day with former \nVice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy and Russian Communist Party \nleader Gennadiy Zyuganov but \"only today\" intended to meet with \nleading officials such as Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and \nAdministration Leader Sergey Filatov.  Shakov also noted the \nformer President's intention to meet with Liberal Democratic \nParty leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and concluded his commentary \nby asking rhetorically whether \"all this\" is a foreign policy \n\"maneuver\" by the U.S. or a \"change in political orientation.\" \n   The news anchor then reported that Richard Nixon was 'expected\" \nto meet with Chernomyrdin and Filatov and hoped to meet with \nRussian President Boris Yeltsin.  The report was followed by \nanother commentary, seemingly designed to embarrass both former \nPresident Nixon and U.S. President Bill Clinton and to suggest \nthat former President Nixon would be reporting to President \nClinton on his Russian visit.  The commentor noted that when he \nreturned to the United States, the former president would be able \nto share not only his impressions from Moscow but also his \"rich \nexperience\" in political scandals, asserting that President \nClinton had already \"suffered through\" some \"unpleasant moments\" \ndue to the \"Whitewater scandal.\"  The news anchor concluded the \nprogram's coverage of the visit with an announcement that he had \n\"just received\" a report from ITAR-TASS that the \"planned\" \nmeetings with Chernomyrdin and Filatov would not take place. \nITAR-TASS was first observed to have run this report at 0745 GMT, \nmore than three hours prior to the beginning of the news \nbroadcast. \n   END BOX \n   (AUTHOR: BELLINGER, CRIMMINS.

An article in \nthe 7 March LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES stated that the revival of Super \n301 \"can only add to the difficulties faced by the (EU) Twelve in \nspeaking with one voice in Marrakesh...\"  However, the 7 March LA \nTRIBUNE DESFOSSES article pointed out that \"in Brussels, as in other \ncapitals, everyone is convinced that (President) Clinton's decision \nis targeted to intimidate only Japan,\" not the EU. \n\n   French press reporting also contained the following official \nstatements, most of which were also critical of the United States. \nFor example: \n\n   * GATT Director Peter Sutherland:  Sutherland was quoted as \nsaying the U.S. action is \"a new effort in bilateral trade, which is \nabout to test the results obtained in the Uruguay Round before they \nare even implemented.\"  (LIBERATION 4 Mar 94)  \"The concept of \nmanaged trade constitutes a dangerous and unfortunate notion.  When \nbureaucrats interfere (in trade), the potential of risks increases.\" \n(LE FIGARO 4 Mar 94) \n\n   * Prime Minister Edouard Balladur:  \"Happy to get rid of the \nlabel of bad boy of world trade,\" Balladur stated that the Super 301 \ndecision \"completely validates the French position that one cannot \nhave a system of free trade where each country creates its own \njustice.\" (LIBERATION 5, 6 Mar 94)  \"It is the negation of an \ninternational free trade system, which is what we have always said \nit was.\" (LE FIGARO 5, 6 Mar 94)  Balladur, criticizing U.S. \n\"threats\" against France as a \"breach of the rules of the game,\" \ndeclared, \"It is proof that we are right to ask for the suppression \nof Super 301.  If we do not, the Uruguay Round agreement will only \nbe hot air.\" (LES ECHOS 7 Mar 94) \n\n   Despite the negative comments by these officials, the press did \nreport a more positive assessment: \n\n   * EU Officials:  An article in LIBERATION claims that while \nofficials in the EU are declaring that they are hostile to the U.S. \nunilateral approach on trade with Japan, in private \"some officials\" \nunderstand U.S. \"aggravation,\" acknowledging that the United States \n\"had first tried everything, all in vain.\"  The article cites one of \nthese unnamed official sources as saying, \"This (Super 301) affair \nmay threaten to deteriorate the climate of trust a bit more, \nespecially in financial markets.  But, if it ends in the Japanese \nmaking a gesture, in them launching a real budgetary effort to \nstimulate domestic demand, then Europe will profit from it.\" \n(LIBERATION 4 March 94) \n\n   U.S.-France Fish Dispute \n\n   The press also noted coUents on the U.S.-France dispute over \nU.S. fish imports to France, on which France had imposed strict \ninspection regulations, prompting the United States to propose \nretaliation against French cheese.  An editorial in the 7 March LA \nTRIBUNE DESFOSSES stated that the United States \"threatened\" \nretaliation because \"the Clinton administration has acted under \npressure from the National Fisheries Institute and the shipowners' \nlobby, arguing that Massachusetts fishermen were losing $200,000 a \nweek because of the restrictions on Fish imports imposed by France.\" \nThe press also reported the following official comments: \n\n   * Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's Staff:  Viewing the \nretaliation threat as an indication of a tougher U.S. trade policy, \nBalladur's staff contended, \"If the United States is stepping up the \npressure on international trade, it is to cast doubt on the Uruguay \nRound's main achievement, which their Senate refuses to consider: \nthe institutionalization of a World Trade Organization.\" (LA TRIBUNE \nDESFOSSES 7 Mar 94) \n\n   Foreign Minister Alain Juppe:  \"Our decision (regarding fish \nimports) conformed perfectly with the applicable Community \nregulations.  If the United States engages in retaliatory measures \nagainst France, they will be responsible for an escalation (of trade \ntensions) just when we are preparing for the Marrakesh \nconference....  One should ask if this would be a good signal.\"  (LE \nFIGARO 5, 6 Mar 94) (DiI) \n\n   FINLAND \n\n   STUDY FINDS JOB TRAINING SUCCEEDING--According to a recent study, \nthe national adult vocational training program has been enjoying \nsome success in the greater Helsinki region.  The study, conducted \nin Uusimaa Province Labor District, which includes the densely \npopulated Helsinki region, found that one of every three district \ntrainees finds a job within two months of leaving the program.  Kari \nKiuru, writing in the 25 February HELSINGIN SANOMAT, claims much of \nthe program's success is due to its flexibility in responding to job \nmarket changes.  Officials constantly monitor these changes and \nsolicit suggestions from industry on, for example, training programs \nwhich could fit the needs of laid-off workers.  New or expanded \ncourses, however, cannot always keep up with rapid changes in \nstudent demands.  The boom in the export sector, for example, has \nled to a recent surge of applications for relevant training:  200 \npeople applied for just 20 available spaces this year. \n\n   In 1994, Uusimaa District will receive 163 million markkas, which \nwill allow it to accept 12,000 students, or about one-tenth of the \nthe area's unemployed.  The district will offer a wide variety of \ntraining opportunities, covering about 100 job fields and divided \ninto some 800 separate courses.  Training lasts anywhere from one \nmonth to as much as an entire year.  (RB) \n\n   (In the hard copy version of West Europe Economic Review, there \nis a graph depicting the \"Participation Distribution of Vocational \nTraining in Uusimaa.\") \n\n   FRANCE \n\n   BALLADUR MODERATES CIP PROVISIONS--Faced with mounting criticism \nfrom labor unions and student demonstrations, Prime Minister Edouard \nBalladur has made \"important\" concessions to change the new \nProfessional Insertion Contract (CIP), a measure which has been \ndenounced by labor, student, and opposition forces as a \ndiscriminatory \"Youth Minimum Wage.\"  According to Delphine Girard \nwriting in the 4 March LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Balladur made these \nconcessions to calm the \"social tempest\" he created in approving a \nlaw to implement the CIP, which originally would have allowed \nemployers to hire those under 26 years of age--even those with a \njunior college degree--for 80 percent of France's guaranteed minimum \nwage (SMIC) and would have required that the company provide a \nmentor \"to help the new employee to begin his career.\"  Balladur has \nagreed to \"redefine\" the CIP, stating that mentors must provide real \ntraining within the company.\"  He has also replaced the provision \nallowing junior college hirees to be paid at 80 percent of the SMIG \nwith the stipulation they must be paid instead at 80 percent of the \n\"conventional minimum wage\" of the industry, which cannot be below \nthe regular SMIC.  Those with no degree, however, may still be hired \nat the below-minimum-wage rate. \n\n   Balladur's concessions were made not only under pressure from \nlabor, students, and opposition groups but also from members of his \nown governing coalition.  An article in the 3 March LA TRIBUNE \nDESFOSSES reported that former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac entered \nthe debate, having declared \"a Youth Minimum Wage is an ill-adapted \nway to solve unemployment,\" bringing with it \"important \ninconveniences.\"  An article in the 4, 5 March LES ECHOS noted that \nChirac had added, \"If we allow companies to hire young people with a \nsalary less than the SMIC, the difference must be counterbalanced by \nreal training in the company...\"  The UDF Youth Movement also made \npublic its objection to Balladur's choice of fighting youth \nunemployment, asking him to \"review his options.\"  The president of \nthe finance committee of the National Assembly, Jacques Barrot, \ncontended that \"the text of the implementation law on CIP is not \nsatisfactory,\" and that the tutorial obligations of companies using \nthe CIP must be better defined.  He also said that \"more detailed \ncoordination on the strategies taken toward junior college graduates \nis needed.\" \n\n   Despite Balladur relenting to these pressures and subsequently \nredefining the CIP provisions, the labor unions are not convinced he \nhas gone far enough, Girard continues in the 4 March LA TRIBUNE \nDESFOSSES.  The unions still refuse to support what they insist on \ncalling the \"Youth Minimum Wage\" for those with no college \neducation, to which Balladur responded, \"Better this than nothing at \nall.\"  Workers Force (FO) head Marc Blondel declared, \"Tensions will \ncontinue.  We still disagree with the prime minister's proposals.\" \nFrench Democratic Confederation of Labor (CFDT) secretary general, \nNicole Notat, claims the government is trying to appear to relent on \nthe issue \"without relenting.\" (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in \nFrench 4 Mar 94 p 2; 3 Mar 94 p 4; Paris LES ECHOS in French 4, 5 \nMar 94 p 2) \n\n   EMPLOYERS STAY OUT OF CIP DEBATE--The controversy that has \nembroiled the government and the labor unions over the CIP is not \nregarded as such by employers, according to an article in LA TRIBUNE \nDESFOSSES.  Employers state that \"there either are jobs or there are \nno jobs.\"  Employing more workers depends above all on business \nactivity and that \"this type of measure (the CIP) can only serve to \nplug holes where personnel are needed for six or eight months,\" or \nuntil the economy picks up.  However, the article claims employers \nview the CIP as \"rather positive,\" noting that apprenticeship \ncontracts have worked well and that the idea of lowering the wage \ncost is nothing new.  The danger, according to employers, is that \nthe CIP is becoming too politicized and is too associated with a \nYouth Minimum Wage.  As for the fears that the young will take jobs \naway from the more experienced, the article cites statements from \nstaff members at the Vallourec company as saying, \"It is a false \nproblem since a company is always tempted to do just that.  The CIP \nwould change nothing.\"  Other employers pointed out that they prefer \na more long-term hiring policy and that in any case, companies are \nlooking for workers with at least a junior college education rather \nthan those with no advanced education. (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE \nDESFOSSES in French 7 Mar 94 p 6) \n\n   INSEE BACKS OFF EMPLOYMENT STUDY CONCLUSIONS--The National \nInstitute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) has modified \nthe conclusions of a study it conducted with the Bureau of \nInformation and Economic Forecasting (BIPE) on the impact on \nemployment of either a reduction in employer's social welfare costs \nor a reduction in youth wages.  The study, ordered by the Senate \nwhen the five-year law on employment was being considered, reported \n(see West Europe Economic Survey Special Report, Vol III, No 7, 24 \nFeb 94) to have established a much sharper macroeconomic effect on \nemployment when employer social charges were reduced (almost 300,000 \nsupplemental jobs in the medium term) than would establishing a \n\"Youth Minimum Wage\" (almost 150,000 more jobs). \n\n   In a communique released on 2 March, INSEE changed its \nconclusion, explaining that it is not possible to determine a \nprecise distinction between the effects of lowering employer costs \nversus lowering youth wages.  (DiI)  (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in \nFrench 4 Mar 94 p 3) \n\n   BANKS USE FROZEN IRAQI FUNDS TO PAY CREDITORS--Three large French \nbanks--Societe Generale, National Bank of Paris (BNP), and the Union \nof French and Arab Banks (UBAF) have used frozen Iraqi assets to \ncompensate the accounts of Iraqi clients without French Treasury \napproval, according to an article in LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE.  After \nmonths of investigation, the Finance Ministry has concluded that \nthese banks have completed financial operations of several hundreds \nof millions of francs, despite the freeze on Iraqi assets in France \ninstituted in August 1990 following the Gulf War.  Economy Minister \nEdmond Alphandery must now set the amount of the fines, which can be \nup to three times the sums in question. \n\n   The banks, having debited and credited accounts of Iraqi clients, \nreduced their financial exposure on Iraq.  In so doing, they have \n\"designated themselves privileged creditors,\" the article notes. \nBetween December 1992 and April 1993, for example, nearly 60 million \nfrancs (Fr) disappeared from Iraqi accounts at UBAF.  The banks \nargue that the transactions were made in \"good faith and in a formal \nmanner.\"  The article points out that some Iraqi creditors were not \nso lucky.  The CED-Viandes and Dumez companies, for example, have \nbeen trying for two years to recoup money from Iraq and have, \nwithout success, been trying to serve the banks with seizure notices \non the Iraqi assets.

The article claims that the thinking of EU \nofficials, meeting currently in Brussels to adopt a couon position \non the next GATT aircraft industry negotiations, has been \"marked\" \nby the \"intervention\" of President Clinton to win the Saudi Airlines \ncontract for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas at the expense of the \nAirbus consortium.  The article claims this augurs poorly for \naircraft industry subsidy negotiations with the United States which, \naccording to Dassault \"is trying to enclose Europeans in rigid \nregulations to which the United States itself does not conform.\" \nAerospatiale President Louis Gallois adds: \"We do not have to go \nalong with the U.S. game of managing the negotiations.  But, we must \ndefend our system of reimbursable advances, which is a good system \nbased on the idea of risk sharing.  At the same time, we must also \nprepare to progressively adopt indirect aid, as it is given in the \nUnited States, in order to have two irons in the fire and to achieve \na balance between the two systems.\" (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in \nFrench 2 Mar 94 p 10) \n\n   EIB TO LOAN FRANCE MORE THAN FR15 MILLION--According to an \narticle in LES ECHOS, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is ready to \nincrease its lending if the EU White Paper plan to increase growth \nand employment in Europe requires it.  The bank loaned nearly Fr130 \nbillion to its target countries in 1993--funds which were raised \nwithout difficulty on the international markets--and the bank has \nthe means to sharply increase its lending, according to bank \npresident, Sir Brian Unwin.  \"With a financing capacity of 144 \nbillion ECU's and a total loan portfolio of 98 billion ECU's, the \nbank can do more for Europe's economy,\" Unwin said. \n\n   In France, the EIB intends to increase its loans for public \nworks, environmental protection, and automobile industry projects. \nLast year the country, which is the fourth largest beneficiary of \nEIB loans after Italy, Spain, and Britain, received Fr14.6 billion \nfrom the bank, a figure more than 13 percent higher than 1992 and \nwhich represents 12.4 percent of total  1993 EIB lending.  This \namount was largely devoted to regional development to reinforce \neconomic and social cohesion in Europe, lending which adheres to EIB \nstatutory goals.  More than 50 percent of the loans were accorded to \nlocal projects in \"industrial decline\" zones or \"delayed \ndevelopment\" areas.  EIB lending for industrial priorities is also \nin line with general EU goals: transportation will receive Fr6.6 \nbillion for the super fast train, TGV Nord, and the Channel tunnel, \nwhile the aircraft industry is slated for Fr1.4 billion.  The \nenvironment will also garner increased support as will the \nautomobile industry.  According to unnamed directors of the bank, \nEIB has \"a very specific project currently under study which would \ninvolve French auto makers Peugeot and Renault.\" (DiI)  (Paris LES \nECHOS in French 28 Feb 94 p 8) \n\n   LONGUET DISCUSSES TEXTILE AID--Industry Minister Gerard Longuet, \nspeaking at a late February roundtable discussion with textile \nmanufacturers, stated that if they had ideas for investment projects \nfor their industry they should submit them to the government \nbecause, \"If there are projects, there will be money.\"  He also \nnoted that the government could allocate Fr160 million to textile- \nclothing investments without any requirements linked to employment. \nSuch allocations would come from new regional funding approved to \naid small to medium-sized industries, which in 1994 will amount to \nFr80O million for various programs.  Additionally, the textile- \nclothing industry will be able to obtain EU funds targeted for \ntraining, of which France's share is Fr700 million and which is to \nbe split among the automobile, electronic, and textile industries. \nThese funds, however, are for training in the broader sense, such as \nthat for trade certification and data processing technicians and not \nfor training related to specific projects.  Longuet repeated that \nwhile these training funds can generally help textile companies, \nspecific \"projects are still needed\" to generate additional help. \n(DiI)  (Paris LES ECH0S in French l Mar 94 p 8) \n\n   WINNERS OF BALLADUR ECONOMICS LISTED--Gerard Desportes and \nNathaniel Herzberg writing in the Paris daily LIBERATION have \nreviewed the results of 10 months of Prime Minister Edouard \nBalladur's administration and has noted that except for the \neducation field where Balladur's attempt to help finance private \nschools failed, many groups gained as a result of his economic \npolicies.

According to Hof, Japanese labor productivity, \nmeasured in terms of real GDP per worker, declined by 1.2 percent in \n1993, compared with only a 0.1 percent drop for Germany.  In fact, \nHof found that the productivity gap between Japanese and German \nindustry continues to widen.  While the recession-related decline in \nproduction has caused the profits of Japanese companies to \"tumble,\" \nGerman firms appear to be recovering and making progress, at least \nin cutting costs.  By reducing workforces and increasing \nproductivity, the Germans have been able to achieve lower unit wage \ncosts and higher profits.  This development also has its darker \nside, however, as evidenced by current unemployment figures and \nfears that, when the next economic upturn comes, the skilled workers \ncurrently unemployed either will no longer be available or will be \nemployable only at \"disproportionately\" high costs.  The Japanese \nshare these fears and are therefore hesitant to lay off permanent \nstaff. \n\n   Hof, arguing that the \"real\" reason for the decline in Japanese \nproductivity is its traditional reluctance to lay off workers, sees \na \"remarkable parallel\" in the German automobile industry, with one \n\"essential\" difference as exemplified by Volkswagen.  Although \nVolkswagen has reduced working hours for its employees by 20 percent \nrather than lay them off, it has benefitted from workers giving up \n12 to 13 percent of their wages.  Consequently, Volkswagen is in a \nbetter wage-cost position than a Japanese company where workers are \nworking fewer hours but drawing full salary.

The agreement calls for \nElf and its German co-owner, Thyssen Handelsunion (THU) to build a \nnew 4.5 billion German marks (DM) refinery with a 10-million- \nton/year capacity; the Trust Agency is pressing Elf to start \nconstruction or risk a DM1.5 billion contract penalty and \ncancellation of the sale of the profitable Minol gas station network \nwhich made the agreement attractive to the French in the first \nplace.  Elf is reportedly looking for new investors so that it can \nbecome a minority shareholder but THU is not interested in \nincreasing its share.  Since the original agreement, oil market \ntrends have dictated that refinery output be reduced, rather than \nincreased, and Elf has begun to privatize some of its own \noperations.  Because Elf's new management is selling stock on the \nmarket, it wants to avoid risky projects and is citing increased \ncompetition, declining demand, and flat economic growth in eastern \nGermany as grounds for revising its investment policy.  Guenter \nRexrodt, German minister of economics, has insisted that Elf begin \nwith the agreed upon construction and maintains that Elf cannot \nreduce its holdings by returning shares to the Trust Agency pending \nresale.  Rexrodt has allowed, however that renegotiation of later \nstages of the agreement may be possible, and notes that contacts are \ncontinuing with other firms, including British Petroleum, which \nshowed interest in Leuna during 1992 negotiations.

At the same time, however,  the ministry has \nexpressed reservations about Russia's ability to meet international \nbusiness standards, which normally dictate making a 15-percent down \npayment on contracts. \n\n   The recently privatized DWA had requested DM765 million in \nguarantees for the current year but the German Government has cut \n1994 credit guarantees to CIS countries from DM4 billion to DM3.5 \nbillion, thus limiting guarantees for individual export contracts. \nConsequently, DWA envisions needing more insurance guarantees in \n1995 and 1996.

Leo Nefiodow \nof the Institute for Mathematics and Data Processing in Sankt \nAugustin contends that Germany has failed to recognize information \ntechnology as the driving force of the latest in a series of 50-year \ngrowth cycles.  Instead of encouraging the development of growth \nindustries in the information field, Nef iodow argues, Germany has \ncontinued to subsidize the dying industries of the previous cycle, \nwhich was characterized by energy-intensive industries like \nautomobiles and petrochemicals.  Consequently, those who believe \nrenewed German prosperity will come with the next economic upturn \n\"will have to wait a long time.\"  In fact, no upturn will come \nunless the country's economic structure adapts to these underlying \nshifts in the world economy. \n\n   In Nefiodow's view, other countries--notably Japan--have done a \nbetter job of riding the latest economic wave.  He notes that only \none German firm--Siemens-Nixdorf--plays a significant role in the \ninformation field, while Japan is represented by over 20 companies. \nNef iodow ascribes Germany's failure to capitalize on the current \ncycle primarily to social and cultural factors.  Germany's emphasis \non individualism and hierarchical forms of organization, he \nmaintains, makes it less able to respond to the demands of the \ninformation age than Japan, with its stress on group well-being and \nteamwork.  While Nefiodow believes it is too late for Germany to \ncatch up, he contends the country may be well positioned to \nanticipate the next one, which he thinks could be driven by the \ninformation, environmental, and health industries, since Germany has \nhigh-quality measurement and process control and software and \nsystems technologies and a top-flight chemical industry.  Above all, \nhowever, he emphasizes Germany's high degree of public awareness of \nenvironmental, health, and information issues.  (RoH)  (Munich \nSUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 21 Feb 94 p 20) \n\n   JOBLESS RATE, POLICIES COMPARED TO WEIMAR REPUBLIC--According to \ncommentator Wolfram Engels, the unemployment rate in Germany is \nalmost as high today as during the Weimar Republic but the German \nGovernment, unlike the Weimar Republic, has failed to alleviate the \nsituation by reducing the cost of labor.  Engels notes that the \nunemployment rate in February 1932 stood at 19.2 percent and that \nthe current rate--counting those in various publicly funded work \nprograms and other \"hidden\" forms of unemployment--has reached 18.2 \npercent.  \"However,\" he writes, \"that's where the similarity ends.\" \nWeimar's Chancellor of the Reich Heinrich Bruening, Engels points \nout, reduced the cost of labor from 5.57 million unemployed from \n5.57 million to 4.1 million by August 1933.  A reduction in the cost \nof labor, Engels maintains, would prove similarly effective today, \nwith an 8-percent cut in real wages sufficient to produce full \nunemployment.  According to Engels, however, the German Government \nis moving in exactly the opposite direction.  Its new nursing care \ninsurance program, he maintains, will \"ignite a rocket\" of labor \ncost increases.  Engels suggests that the program could increase the \ncost of labor by 6 percent or more within a few years, inevitably \nleading to a further loss of jobs.

Cologne's Institute for the German Economy \n(IW) reports that 2.66 million more Germans could be employed if the \npercentage of part-time workers in the labor force were raised from \nthe current 15.5 to the 34.3 percent found in the Netherlands. \nExperts note, however, that the service sector would have to be \nsignificantly expanded and the proportion of working women slightly \nreduced if this adjustment were to succeed.

In so doing, he \nelicited strong political reactions from his own party, the Spanish \nSocialist Workers Party (PSOE) and opposition groups.  The article \nnoted that the Spanish pension system, which is administered and \nfunded by the government, increased spending 73.5 percent during \n1989-93 and that forecasts indicate a 20 percent increase by 1997. \nHowever, Solbes publicly reassured workers that the system could \nstill pay benefits but not over the long term.  He attributed this \nproblem to an aging population, longer life expectancy, fewer \ncontributors, and more annuitants.  Solbes suggested substituting \nthe current payment system for one which more closely resembles a \ndefined contribution plan rather than the current defined benefit \nplan, which guarantees pension benefits regardless of the amount \ncontributed.  Currently, contributions are mandatory for 15 years. \n\n   An article in the 23 February EL PAlS claims that Solbes's \nremarks created a sharp reaction from factions within the PSOE. \nAlthough Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez defended Solbes by \nstating that he had acted in a manner which \"brings him credit,\" he \nadded that government pensions do not represent \"a problem for today \nor tomorrow.\"  Gonzalez reassured current pensioners that they were \nwell protected\" and that there would always be decent government \nretirement benefits for all citizens.  He also said that \"problems \nwould not surface until the years 2020 or 2025\" but governments \nneeded to prepare in advance for changes in Spanish demographics. \nSocialist senator Juan Barranco stated, \"this type of declaration \nunfortunately makes the PSOE lose votes and creates uncertainty \namong the citizenry.\" \n\n   This same article states that reaction from opposition groups was \n\"far more belligerent\" than that from the PSOE.  People's Party (PP) \nspokesman Rodrigo Rato demanded that Solbes appear before the \nparliament to explain the government's position on social security \nissues.  Rato characterized the finance minister's remarks as \n\"irresponsible\" and criticized him for \"scaring people.\"  According \nto United Left (IU) Coordinator General Julio Anguita: \"Solbes is \nonly stating the obvious.  There is not going to be enough growth in \nemployment to generate the necessary resources to be able to pay out \nretirement pensions.\"  Additionally, Fernando Gimeno, coordinator of \nthe joint committee for the Office of the Controller of the \nCurrency, reproached Solbes by stating that \"such declarations only \ncreate uncertainty among people from lower income brackets who don't \nhave the money to contribute to pension plans.\"  Gimeno added that \nthe government was now working on reforming the taxation system for \ngovernment pensions and he thought it \"unfortunate\" that people were \ntrying to come up with scenarios for 15 years hence. \n\n   Responding to the criticisms, Solbes remarked that the government \nwould continue to guarantee pensions but reaffirmed that \"it will be \nnecessary to review them\" given the change in Spanish demographics. \nDeputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra agreed, stating that in the \nfuture the state system would guarantee a \"decent pension.\"  (CH) \n(Madrid EL PAlS in Spanish 22 Feb p 45; 23 Feb 94 p 39) \n\n   LABOR REFORM INCLUDES REVIEW OF DISABILITY BENEFITS--An article \nin EL PAlS notes that the Labor Ministry is working on reforms \nencompassing disability, unemployment, and health issues in the work \nplace, which would complete the labor market legislation being \nconsidered in parliament.  The Labor Ministry plans to blur two \ndistinct categories which define workers as either \"temporarily \nincapacitated\" or \"temporarily disabled.\"  These definitions would \nbe combined into a single \"temporary\" category, paying benefits for \nless than the current six years.  By reducing the time that someone \nwould spend on \"temporary disability\" before going on to be declared \n\"permanently disabled,\" the Labor Ministry hopes to return workers \nto their jobs once they have overcome health problems so they do not \nremain on disability for six years.  Funds would then be directed \nexclusively to those who really need them. \n\n   The Labor Ministry also plans to establish teams, which would be \nadministered by doctors working for the Social Security system, to \nevaluate disabled workers (EVI).  According to the article, the \ndoctors will introduce more rigorous standards for the evaluation \nprocess to return employees more quickly to the work place.  These \ndoctors would also review pensions which are in force to determine \nthe status of disability benefits in the event that the worker \nshould recover.

When the First UOU Congress met in July \n1991, press reports said that Rukh had organized it specifically \nto pursue this goal (TASS, 29 July 1991; Kiev radio, 27 July \n1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991).

Vitaliy Chechylo was a \ndeputy chairman of the organizing committee; and the congress \nelected Rukh Political Council member Col. Vilen Martirosyan as \nthe UOU's first chairman (TASS, 29 July 1991; Komsomolskaya \nPravda, 18 September 1991; Narodnaya Armiya, 29 June 1992). \n   With a large majority of its members ethnic Ukrainians and \nretired or reserve rather than active-duty officers, the UOU has \nalways been more a Ukrainian nationalist organization than a \nmilitary one.  Eighty-five percent of its members are ethnic \nUkrainians, a proportion far higher than that in the armed forces \noverall (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). (See Note 1)  Only \nhalf of the delegates to the First UOU Congress were on active \nduty (Interfax, 29 July 1991).  At its most recent congress it \nwas reported that twice as many members were retired as were on \nactive duty, and that many UOU officers, including oblast \norganization chairmen, are either in the reserves or retired from \nthe service (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994).  Many of the \nunion's organizers were not military men.  For instance, Mulyava \nand Oleksandr Yemets (See Note 2) were civilians.  Other key \nleaders, such as former UOU chairmen Hryhoriy Omelchenko and \nOleksandr Skypalskyy, were career police officers (See Appendix \nC:  Biographical Information). \n   (Note 1) In 1992, according to then-military personnel chief \nOleksandr Ihnatenko, eighty-five percent of servicemen in Ukraine \nwere ethnic Russians (Narodnaya Armiya, 5 May 1992). \n   (Note 2) Yemets, leader of the Party of Democratic Revival of \nUkraine, was a deputy chairman of the First UOU Congress \norganizing committee (Kiev radio, 27 July 1991). \n   The rapid disintegration of the USSR led the UOU to shift its \nattention from its original goal of creating a Ukrainian national \narmy to influencing the nascent army's development.  As the \nSoviet state rapidly withered awaY in the wake of the August 1991 \ncoup attempt, Ukraine enacted a package of laws in October 1991 \nto create its own armed forces by placing Soviet forces stationed \nin Ukraine under Ukrainian government control.  Ukraine also \nappointed its own defense minister, Konstyantyn Morozov.  The UOU \nthen set itself the task of shaping the armed forces--especially \nthe officer corps--in what it considered a patriotic mold.  In \npractice, this meant striving to influence decisions on \nappointments, promotions, and dismissals, as well as seeking a \nleading role in military indoctrination activities.  In November \n1991, the Second UOU Congress demanded that all appointments, \n\"from battalion commander on up,\" be \"coordinated with\" the UOU \n(Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 November 1991). (See Note 3)  The congress \nalso passed several resolutions calling for an acceleration of \nthe creation of a Ukrainian army and for measures to assure that \nthe army be manned by soldiers whose first loyalty was to \nUkraine.  In March 1992, then-First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy \nChechylo said that the UOU should \"take a most active part\" in \nmilitary personnel matters (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992). \n   (Note 3) The Soviet Defense Ministry was not reported to respond \ndirectly to these demands, but a few days after the congress \nDefense Minister Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov decried \"centrifugal \ntendencies\" in military affairs (Krasnaya Zvezda, 7 November \n1991).  The nascent Ukrainian Defense Ministry was also \napparently silent; the newly-appointed minister, Morozov, \naddressed the congress but was not reported to discuss a role for \nthe UOU in military personnel matters (Moscow Russian TV, 2 \nNovember 1991).  Subsequently, however, Morozov strongly backed \nUOU aspirations in this area (See below, page   ). \n   From the beginning, many officers stationed in Ukraine- \n-particularly among the ethnic Russian majority of the officer \ncorps--were hostile to the UOU, evidently fearing that its \ninfluence in personnel decisions boded ill for them personally. \nAs early as the end of 1991, an assembly of air defense officers \naccused the union of seeking to arrogate to itself the powers of \nnewly minted commissars\" and to revive \"democratic centralism\" \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 14 December 1991).  Rival servicemen's groups \nsprang up, often with the apparent purpose of opposing the UOU. \nAccording to reports in the Moscow press, groups such as the \nIndependent Officers Association (based in Vinnytsya, \nheadquarters of the predominantly Russian 43rd Missile Army) and \nthe Kiev Constructive Union sought to protect their members and \nthe armed forces overall from what they charged were UOU \"witch \nhunts\" for supporters of the 1991 coup attempt.  The UOU \nactively, but unsuccessfully, opposed these groups' creation \n(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 November 1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 26 \nNovember 1991). \n   Defense Minister Morozov Encourages the UOU \n   Despite the hostility of many officers, the UOU at first \nflourished, helped by the friendly attitude of nationalist-minded \nDefense Minister Morozov.  Morozov signalled early on that his \nthinking on military matters paralleled that of Rukh and the UOU. \nHe told a Moscow News interviewer that Ukraine needed its own \narmed forces as soon as possible to guarantee its independence, \nechoing earlier statements by Rukh leaders (See above, page  ). \nIn the same interview, he said that he shared the concerns \nexpressed at the Second UOU Congress over the loyalties of the \nofficers then stationed on Ukrainian territory (3-10 November \n1991).  A UOU Executive Committee session was held on Ukrainian \nDefense Ministry premises in January 1992, the members \ncongratulating themselves on their new-found establishment \ninsider status (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992).  Several UOU \nleaders were appointed to important Defense Ministry and Security \nService posts where they were well-placed to pursue the UOU's \nagenda in personnel and related matters.  In December 1991, UOU \nChairman Martirosyan was appointed chairman of the government's \nnew Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS), with \nFirst Deputy Chairman Chechylo as one of his top aides (Narodnaya \nArmiya, 29 January, 11 March 1992).  A UOU Executive Committee \nmember, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, headed the Security Service's \nMilitary Counterintelligence Directorate (Molod Ukrayiny, 17 \nOctober 1991).  UOU Deputy Chairman Hryhoriy Omelchenko was \nespecially well placed to weed out supposedly undesirable \nofficers, heading the organized crime unit in Skypalskyy's \ndirectorate as well as sitting on the Defense Ministry Higher \nCertification Committee, which vets senior appointments \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 30 January 1993; Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993). \n   \"Ukrainianizing\" the Armed Forces \n   The UOU scored one of its greatest successes with the appointment \nof Volodymyr Mulyava, deputy chairman of both the UOU and Rukh, \nas chief of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's new Socio- \nPsychological Service.  This service was organized on the basis \nof ideas developed by Mulyava in his capacity as a Rukh deputy \nchairman to inculcate Ukrainian patriotism and national identity \namong the troops (See Appendix C: Biographical Information).  To \nthis end, Mulyava launched a highly controversial program \nrequiring servicemen to learn the Ukrainian language, history, \nand traditions (Syn Otechestva No. 7, February 1992; Narodna \nArmiya, 29 July 1992).  President Leonid Kravchuk endorsed the \nprogram--at least in principle--at a Ukrainian Security Council \nmeeting in late 1992 (Narodna Armiya, 9 December 1992).  However, \nMulyava's critics--both in Ukraine and in Russia--charged that he \nactually sought to purge ethnic Russians from the officer corps \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 1 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 3 December 1992; \nInterfax, 6 January 1993; Pravda, 13 May 1993), a claim which he \nand other UOU and Defense Ministry officials heatedly and \nrepeatedly denied (Kiev radio, 6 February 1992; Narodna Armiya, 5 \nMay 1992, 3 December 1992, 17 April 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 22 \nNovember 1992). \n   The UOU's influence in the Ukrainian government and armed forces \nreached a peak in the spring and summer of 1992.  Senior military \nand political figures addressed its Third Congress, which met in \nApril 1992 and attracted 918 delegates, the largest number ever \n(Ukrinform, 6 April 1992).  Congress speakers congratulated the \nunion on the large role it was now playing in military affairs \n(Golos Ukrainy, 7 April 1993;  Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). \nUOU leaders had expansive ideas about the organization's present \nand future role in military affairs.  For instance, a \"Draft UOU \nProgram,\" signed by several top union leaders and published in \nthe Defense Ministry newspaper Narodnaya Armiya on 4 June 1992, \nmapped out ambitious goals for direct UOU involvement in drafting \nmilitary legislation, personnel decisions, training, \nindoctrination, and social welfare of servicemen.  On 24 June \n1992, Morozov ordered that the UOU should be involved in \nidentifying and removing corrupt officers (Molod Ukrayiny, 23 \nJuly 1992). \n   The UOU Under Attack, Fights Back \n   Even as its influence peaked in the middle of 1992, the UOU was \napparently encountering growing resistance from the defense \nestablishment--despite Morozov's friendly attitude--as well as \nfrom politicians outside the military.  The critics said that its \ninfluence within the military establishment was excessive and \ndecried the ends for which that influence was being used.  For \ninstance, in an interview published on the eve of the Third UOU \nCongress, Yevhen Hryniv, a moderate Rukh member of parliament, \ncomplained that the UOU had fixated on the \"nationality question\" \nand said its decisions should be taken by the armed forces only \nas recommendations (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 April 1992).  Several \nmonths later, a favorable article on Mulyava's activities claimed \nthat the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodna Armiya was developing \na  disloyal attitude\" toward him (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 22 November \n1992).  At the end of 1992, 155 members of parliament called for \nMorozov's dismissal, on the grounds that he had supposedly \nallowed the UOU--in particular Mulyava--to \"control\" military \npersonnel policy and to impose its \"nationalist ideology\" on the \ntroops (Interfax, 6 January 1993). (See Note 4) \n   (Note 4) Press reports have not been observed to describe the \npolitical leanings of the 155 deputies, although Morozov's \nsupporters consistently described them as communists.  Among the \norganizers of the call for Morozov's dismissal were Col. Valeriy \nIzmalkov, a deputy from Zaporizhzhya in the mainly Russian \neastern Ukraine and an inveterate foe of the UOU; Oleksiy \nPrychkin, also from Zaporizhzhya and a former high communist \nparty official; Maj. Gen. F. Kiparis; MVD Lt. Gen. O. Badurka; \nand Viktor Slyusarenko (Holos Ukrayiny, 6 January 1993; \nNezavisimost, 13 October 1993). \n   Belligerent Response to Criticism \n   In response, UOU leaders rose to Morozov's defense, while they \naccused their critics in the military  and parliament of being \ncorrupt, unpatriotic, and pro-communist.  Hryhoriy Omelchenko, \nelected UOU chairman at its Third Congress, repeatedly complained \nthat a \"nomenklatura mafia\" in the government, parliament, and \narmed forces was blocking his efforts to prosecute officers whom \nhe accused of corruption, communist sympathies and subservience \nto Russia.  Omelchenko also claimed that criticism of Morozov was \nmotivated precisely by Morozov's support for the UOU's anti- \ncorruption efforts (Nezavisimost, 18 July 1992; Molod Ukrayiny, \n23 July 1992; Kiev TV, 13 January 1993; Uryadovyy Kuryer, 3O \nJanuary 1993; Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993; Molod Ukrayiny, 15 July \n1993; Khreshchatyk, 8 October 1993).  Mulyava dismissed the \naccusations in parliament against himself and Morozov as \ncomical,\" describing Morozov's critics as \"conservative \ngenerals\" and \"pro-imperialist and pro-communist forces\" seeking \nto protect \"corruption and abuses in the armed forces\" (Kiev \nradio, 6 February 1993).  Morozov in turn defended Mulyava \nagainst charges of discrimination against ethnic Russians \n(Narodna Armiya, 17 April 1993).  The UOU issued a combative \nstatement, published in Narodna Armiya on 4 February 1993, \ndecrying \"political provocations by pro-communist, chauvinist \n[pro-Russian] forces,\" which it said could lead to civil war and \nthe loss of Ukrainian independence. \n   Furthermore, after the Third UOU Congress in April 1992, pressure \nfrom opponents began to unravel the web of personal links that \nthe UOU had so successfully created between itself and the \ndefense establishment, a process abetted by the endemic factional \nand personal rivalries within the UOU itself.  Martirosyan and \nChechylo, the UOU's two most prominent figures in the area of \nservicemen's social welfare, broke with the union after the Third \nCongress (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993).  In March 1993, Morozov \ndismissed Deputy Minister for Personnel Oleksandr Ihnatenko, a \nkey UOU ally, for allegedly tolerating corruption (Narodna \nArmiya, 26 March, 17 April 1993). \n   Meanwhile, there was infighting within the leadership of the UOU. \nMartirosyan was forced out from the UOU chairmanship at the Third \nCongress under heavy pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) \nand after his deputy, Chechylo, had publicly criticized him for \nbeing reluctant to step down (Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992). \nVolodymyr Pylypchuk, a UOU deputy chairman as well as deputy \nchief of the Defense Ministry Military Education Directorate, \nattacked the UOU leadership--at that point chaired by Omelchenko- \n-for \"authoritarian methods,\" incompetence and poor organization \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 19 June 1992).  In December 1992, Chechylo, at \nthat point no longer a UOU official but still identifying himself \nas a UOU member, accused Omelchenko of tolerating and even \nencouraging corruption within the UOU leadership (Pravda Ukrainy, \n21 December 1992).  The following year, Oleksandr Skypalskyy, who \nhad just been elected UOU chairman at the Fourth Congress in \nApril 1993, told an interviewer that Omelchenko, his predecessor \nas chairman and his subordinate in the Security Service, had used \nhis UOU position to advance his own career (Narodna Armiya, 13 \nMay 1993). \n   The Fourth UOU Congress \n   Despite clear signs that its opponents' attacks were taking a \ntoll on the union, the UOU made it clear at its Fourth Congress \nin April 1993 that it was not backing down on its ambitions to \nplay a leading role in military policy.  Attendance, as compared \nwith the Third Congress a year earlier, was down sharply, from \n918 delegates to about 6OO.  Outgoing Chairman Omelchenko said \nUkraine was facing \"difficult times\" in the economy, which he \nblamed on the \"nomenklatura\" parliament.  Other speakers \ncriticized parliament for failing either to enact a military \ndoctrine or to cut back the size of the armed forces, accusing it \nof protecting servicemen whom the UOU thought should be dismissed \nfor corruption or disloyalty.  The congress also expressed \nconsiderable dissatisfaction\" with the activities of the \ngovernment's Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen \n(CSPS) and called--unsuccessfully--for the dismissal of CSPS \nChairman Martirosyan, a former UOU chairman who was by that point \nestranged from the union (Ukrinform, 6 April 1992; Narodna \nArmiya, 13 April 1993).  Addressing the congress, Morozov praised \nthe UOU's activities and said that it \"should not be a bystander\" \nin personnel and indoctrination matters (Narodna Armiya, 13 April \n1993; Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 27 April 1993), advice the UOU seemed \ninclined to take to heart.  Its new chairman, Oleksandr \nSkypalskyy, asserted shortly afterwards that the Fourth Congress \nhad been held \"exclusively to affirm the readiness and aspiration \nof the UOU to take an active part in the building of the \nUkrainian army\" (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). \n   New Defense Minister Cracks Down on the UOU \n   The UOU's position within the military establishment suffered an \nespecially serious decline after Vitaliy Radetskyy's appointment \nin October 1993 as defense minister, replacing Morozov. \nRadetskyy brought with him a reputation as a foe of the UOU \n(Narodna Armiya, 17 September 1992), a reputation he did nothing \nto dispel.  Asked in parliament about his attitude toward the \nUOU, he was implicitly hostile, saying that the question of \ndissolving the union needed to be \"studied attentively.\"  He was \nnoncommittal when asked his evaluation of Socio-Psychological \nService Chief Volodymyr Mulyava's activities, though he did tell \nan interviewer later that he would slow down--but not eliminate- \n-Mulyava's controversial program to promote use of the Ukrainian \nlanguage in the armed forces (Kiev radio, 8 October 1993; Moloda \nHalychyna, 14 October 1993).  Meanwhile, the parliament sought to \ncurtail the UOU's role, enacting a new Military Doctrine which \nbanned political activity by servicemen (Golos Ukrainy, 29 \nOctober 1993).  Omelchenko--clearly seeing the ban as a serious \nthreat--called it a \"gross violation of human rights\" (UNIAN, 3 \nNovember 1993). (See Note 5) \n   (Note 5) Ironically, only four months earlier, the Fourth UOU \nCongress had criticized the parliament's delay in enacting a \nmilitary doctrine (Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993). \n   Once in office, Radetskyy took several steps to curtail the UOU's \ninfluence.  He shifted Mulyava to a new position as deputy \ndefense minister for ties with the public, parties, and \nmovements, a shift seen as a blow to Mulyava and the UOU, since \nit removed him from involvement in personnel-related matters. \nRadetskyy also removed Mulyava from the Higher Certification \nCommission, along with two UOU allies, former Defense Ministry \npersonnel chief Oleksandr Ihnatenko and Yuriy Prokofyev, chief of \nthe Defense Ministry Military Education Directorate (UNIAN, 2 \nDecember 1993).  These actions led commentators to claim that the \nministry was conducting a \"purge\" of UOU activists (Narodna \nHazeta No. 44, November 1993; Valentyn Labunskyy in Holos \nUkrayiny, 12, 17 November 1993).  One commentary in a nationalist \nLviv newspaper even claimed that Radetskyy was serving Russia's \ninterests by making these changes (Andriy Starostin in Post- \nPostup, 2 December 1993).  Radetskyy reportedly forbade officers \nto write for publication--supposedly in response to a critical \narticle by Air Force Major General Oleksandr Rol, (See Note 6) a \nUOU member who was subsequently elected the union's chairman \n(UNIAN, 3 November 1993).  Radetskyy also revoked Morozov's 1992 \norder giving the UOU a role in personnel matters (Kievskiye \nVedomosti, 27 November 1993). \n   (Note 6) Rol's article, published only a few days after \nRadetskyy's appointment, excoriated the Defense Ministry \nleadership for incompetence and corruption and asserted that the \nmilitary was incapable of reforming itself without the \ninvolvement of outsiders (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 13 October 1993). \n   Radetskyy's apparent hostility toward the UOU communicated itself \ndown the chain of command.  Some unit commanders reportedly tried \nto suppress UOU activities (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 22 November \n1993).  In December, the UOU's Kiev organization appealed to \nRadetskyy to put a stop to what it called \"arbitrariness\" and \n\"pressure\" against UOU activists by commanders (Molod Ukrayiny, \n17 December 1993).  UOU officials also claimed that the Defense \nMinistry had attempted to prevent officers on active duty from \nattending the UOU's Fifth Congress, granting permission only at \nthe last moment (Halychyna, 4 January 1994).  At the congress, \ntwo delegates claimed that the military command was trying to \n\"ban\" UOU representatives from certification commissions at all \nlevels, which vet appointments (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994). \n   UOU Remains Defiant, Steps Up Political Activity \n   The Fifth UOU Congress \n   When the Fifth UOU Congress met in December 1993, the \norganization's estrangement from the defense establishment was \nnear-total.  Attendance was down again, to a mere 225 delegates, \nless than a quarter of the attendance at the Third Congress a \nyear and a half earlier.  Outgoing Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy \nand other participants attributed the decline to \"persecution\" of \nUOU members by commanders (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993; \nHalychyna, 4 January 1994).  No top Defense Ministry officials \nattended (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994); by contrast, Morozov \nand other senior figures had addressed the Second, Third and \nFourth Congresses (Moscow Russian TV, 2 November 1991; Narodnaya \nArmiya, 8 April 1992; Narodna Armiya, 13 April 1993).  In \ncontrast to its extensive favorable coverage of earlier UOU \ncongresses, the Defense Ministry newspaper Narodna Armiya \npublished only a short Ukrinform report on the Fifth Congress (22 \nDecember 1993). \n   The congress's mood was defiant.  It elected a new chairman, Rol, \nwho was already in disfavor with the Defense Ministry and who was \nrumored to be on the verge of dismissal from the armed forces in \nretaliation for the critical article he had published in October \n(Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993, 6 January 1994).  Speakers \nattacked the government for not spending enough on defense and \nfailing to promote arms exports (Kiev TV, 18 December 1993; \nHalychyna, 4 January 1994).  Delegates gave a standing ovation to \na fiery speech threatening to revive the 1940's anti-Soviet \nUkrainian Insurrection Army if \"anybody\" prevented the UOU from \nplaying what it considered its proper role (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 \nDecember 1993).  Mulyava called on the UOU, despite the \"new \nconditions,\" to expand its influence \"in all spheres of army \nlife\" (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 6 January 1994).  Another UOU official, \nBohdan Vivchar, assailed the UOU's parliamentary critics as \n\"national chauvinist [pro-Russian] forces\" who sought to \"prevent \nthe consolidation of an independent Ukrainian state through the \nbuilding of strong armed forces\" (Halychyna, 4 January 1994). \nDelegates also pointed to recent opinion polls showing high \npopular support for the officer corps, evidently seeing this as \nproof that the UOU was in a stronger political position than its \ncritics (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993, 6 January 1994). \n   Parliamentary Election Campaign Activity \n   Faced with official hostility and with its influence within the \nestablishment on the decline, the UOU is re-emphasizing its long- \nstanding links with Rukh and other nationalist groups in \npreparation for the March 1994 parliamentary election.  In \nDecember 1993, UOU Deputy Chairman Omelchenko appealed for all \n\"democratic\" groups to unite during the election campaign and to \nrun a single \"democratic\" candidate in each parliamentary \ndistrict (Interfax, 17 December 1993).  Addressing the Fifth UOU \nCongress, Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil likewise appealed for \nunity of all \"democratic and patriotic forces\" in the election \ncampaign and urged the union to \"engage in political activity \nmore daringly\" (Molod Ukrayiny, 24 December 1993).  While the UOU \nis clearly taking an active role in the campaign, these appeals \nfor unity are meeting with mixed success.  The Fifth Congress \ndecided to run UOU candidates in all regions of the country \n(Halychyna, 4 January 1994)--a goal the union is unlikely to \nachieve--while at the same time UOU is participating in the All- \nUkrainian Electoral Committee of the Democratic Bloc with Rukh \nand several other nationalist groups to try to unite behind \ncommon candidates (Interfax, 17 December 1993; UNIAR, 4 January \n1994). \n   At least six UOU leaders are candidates for parliament:  Rol; \nOmelchenko; Skypalskyy; Mulyava; Guards Lieutenant Colonel \nOleksandr Lobashchuk, a member of the UOU's Executive Committee \nand deputy chairman of its Lviv Oblast organization; and Vasyl \nKrychun, a local government official and deputy chairman of the \nIvano-Frankivsk Oblast UOU organization.  All but Krychun are \napparently defying the Military Doctrine ban on political \nactivity, since they remain on active duty.  Five of the six are \nrunning in nationalist western Ukraine, the UOU's main power \nbase.  Rol is running in Lviv Oblast on the ticket of the \nCongress of Ukrainian Nationalists, Lobashchuk also in Lviv \nOblast as an independent supported by the UOU, Skypalskyy in \nVolyn Oblast, and Mulyava and Krychun in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast \n(Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 4, 14 January, 24 February 1994; Vechirniy \nKyyiv, 21 December 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 12 January 1994; \nHalychyna, 27 January, 12 February 1994).  Omelchenko is running \nin Kiev as a candidate of the Party for Democratic Revival of \nUkraine (UNIAR, 29 December 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 4 January \n1994). \n   Prospects \n   Despite the reverses it has suffered since mid-1992, the UOU is \nclearly determined to remain a force in Ukrainian military \npolicy.  Recent statements by the UOU's leaders show that it has \nnot abandoned its central ambition of playing a leading role in \nshaping the armed forces and acting as the guardian of their \nloyalty and honesty.  Its vigorous activity in the parliamentary \nelection campaign shows its determination to seek alternate means \nto exert influence on the military even in the face of the \nDefense Ministry's hostility.  Its strong and long-standing links \nwith Rukh and other important political groups will probably be \nhelpful to it in this endeavor. \n   Appendix A:  The UOU'S Agenda \n   UOU spokesmen have said that the union's goal is to ensure that \nall members of Ukraine's officer corps will be honest, competent, \nand loyal to Ukraine (See for example the UOU Draft Program in \nNarodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992; as well as interviews by then-UOU \nFirst Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo in Narodnaya Armiya, 28 \nMarch 1992; then-UOU Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy and Kiev local \norganization Chairman Volodymyr Saladyak in Narodna Armiya, 13 \nMay 1993; and current UOU Chairman Oleksandr Rol in Samostiyna \nUkrayina, 5 February 1994).  Stated in such general terms, these \ngoals are hardly controversial and in fact have been endorsed \neven by the UOU's opponents, including Radetskyy (see his \narticles in Armiya Ukrayiny, 26 January 1994, and in Ukrayinska \nHazeta, 2 February 1994).  Controversy has centered instead on \nthe UOU's aspiration to play a direct and leading role in \npersonnel decisions, down to the level of influencing individual \nappointments and dismissals, as well as on its criteria- \n-particularly ethnicity--for ensuring loyalty to Ukraine. \n   Beyond its primary interest in influencing personnel and \nindoctrination, the UOU has also pledged to work for better \nliving conditions for servicemen and to prevent the \nmisappropriation of military property, either by corrupt \nindividuals or by Russia.  Its focus on Ukrainian nationalism is \ndisplayed in its strenuous opposition to Crimean separatism.  It \nhas also lobbied against ceding control of the former Soviet \nBlack Sea Fleet to Russia and against the presence of any foreign \ntroops in Ukraine (Khreshchatyk, 3 March 1994). \n   Military Personnel, Indoctrination and Loyalty Issues \n   The UOU's attempts to shape Ukraine's officer corps has been its \nmain raison d'etre almost from the beginning.  Two key UOU \nleaders, Hryhoriy Omelchenko and Volodymyr Mulyava (See Appendix \nC: Biographical Information) have played the most prominent roles \nin this area.  Omelchenko has sought to use his positions in the \nSecurity Service and on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification \nCommission to weed out unsuitable officers--though he claims to \nhave been thwarted in these efforts by entrenched conservatives \nin government (See above, page  ).  Mulyava, meanwhile, took the \nlead in attempting to mold servicemen into what he and the UOU \nconsidered Ukrainian patriots.  It remains unclear to what extent \nthis meant--as critics charged--favoring ethnic Ukrainians over \nethnic Russians (See above, page   ).  However, UOU leaders \nfrequently warned union audiences against the danger of ethnic \ndiscrimination, suggesting that at least some UOU supporters, \ndespite denials, may have in fact pursued discrimination against \nRussians.  For instance, UOU Deputy Chairman Andriy Haysynskyy \ntold an interviewer in 1991 that \"in my opinion\" ethnicity should \nhave no significance, implying that others did not share that \nview (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 2O September 1991).  At the Third UOU \nCongress, Deputy Chairman V. Lazorkin said the union should \n\"help\" military personnel authorities \"make correct appointments \nto key posts,\" which should be filled only by \"true patriots.\" \nWhile Lazorkin's statement was not unambiguously a call for \nethnic discrimination, it may have been understood as such. \nOmelchenko, who was elected UOU chairman the next day, responded \nto Lazorkin by warning against seeking \"enemies\" on the basis of \ntheir ethnicity (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  The concern \nwith ethnicity seems to be lingering, however, even among the \nUOU's friends; an interviewer for the nationalist newspaper Za \nVilnu Ukrayinu praised newly-elected UOU Chairman Oleksandr Rol's \n\"good idiomatic Ukrainian\" as evidence of his \"healthy family \nroots\" (14 January 1994). \n   Whatever its views on ethnicity, the UOU clearly will not \nwillingly give up its claim to a role in shaping Ukraine's \nofficer corps.  In a recent interview, newly-elected Chairman \nOleksandr Rol, while making conciliatory statements about the new \nDefense Ministry leadership, asserted that \"We [the UOU] consider \nit our duty to indoctrinate army personnel in the spirit of \nUkrainian patriotism and glorious traditions of the Ukrainian \nArmy\" (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February 1994). \n   The UOU has also pushed insistently to require all officers to \nswear allegiance to the Ukrainian state.  Characteristically, the \nunion presented itself as the guarantor that this goal would be \nachieved.  It early on created a data bank to identify officers \nwho had or had not taken the oath (Moscow Ostankino TV, 29 \nJanuary 1992).  Then-UOU Chairman Vilen Martirosyan said he would \nuse this data to lobby for the dismissal of all commanders who \nrefused the oath (Moscow radio, 18 March 1992). \n   The Defense Ministry has endorsed this goal, but not a UOU role \nin enforcing it.  In mid-1992, then-military personnel chief \nOleksandr Ihnatenko, a UOU ally, said that all officers who \nrefused the oath would be transferred to service in Russia or \nother former Soviet republics (Krasnaya Zvezda, 9 June 1992). \nOne officer, Major Grigoriy Nesmyanovich, claimed that this in \npractice meant denying salaries and other benefits to officers \nwho refused the oath as a way of pressuring them to leave Ukraine \nvoluntarily (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 July 1992).  Defense Minister \nVitaliy Radetskyy, a UOU opponent, recently ordered that any \nremaining officers who had not taken the oath be removed from \nactive service (UNIAN, 1 February 1994). \n   Yet another aspect of UOU involvement in military personnel \nmatters has been its campaign to bring Ukrainian servicemen, \nstationed in other parts of the former Soviet Union or in Eastern \nEurope, \"home\" to Ukraine.  Shortly after the dissolution of the \nSoviet Union, the UOU Executive Committee called for an \ninterstate agreement to send all former Soviet servicemen to \ntheir \"native\" republics (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992). \nThen-Defense Minister Konstyantyn Morozov told the Third UOU \nCongress that the \"return\" of these servicemen would help to \n\"Ukrainianize\" the army (Golos Ukrainy, 7 April 1992). \n   Protection of Military Property \n   The UOU has cast itself as the protector of military property \nfrom both theft and attempts by Russian authorities to \nappropriate equipment claimed by Ukraine.  The subject was raised \nat the Second UOU Congress (Literaturna Ukrayina, 7 November \n1991) and at a January 1992 UOU Executive Committee session \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992).  At its Third Congress, the \nUOU took credit for protecting military property against \nmisappropriation (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  The Third \nCongress highlighted its concern with the corruption issue by \nelecting Security Service Col. Hryhoriy Omelchenko as UOU \nchairman.  Although Omelchenko has complained that he has been \nprevented by conservative politicians from carrying out this \nmandate (See above, page    ), the UOU nonetheless remains \ndetermined to attempt to police the military.  The head of the \nUOU Lviv Oblast organization, Mykola Vasylkevych, recently \nasserted that \"the UOU will take a most active part\" in \ninventorying and protecting military property, \"from ships under \nconstruction to the last cartridge\" (Shlyakh Peremohy, 15 January \n1994). \n   \"Social Protection\" of Servicemen \n   The problem of the shortage of housing and other amenities for \nmilitary officers evidently presented a dilemma for the UOU. \nWhile any organization aspiring to influence among servicemen in \nthe former Soviet Union must address this issue, Ukraine's near- \ncatastrophic economic situation makes it difficult for any group \nto deliver on its promises.  Although the union \ncharacteristically at first presented itself as the guarantor \nthat living standards would improve, it eventually backed off its \nearlier aspirations and promises.  It may be a testament to the \nintractability of the problem that the UOU officials most \nidentified with the social welfare issue, founding Chairman Vilen \nMartirosyan and former First Deputy Chairman Vitaliy Chechylo, \nhave both fallen out with the organization (See Appendix C: \nBiographical Information). \n   The UOU urged, and took credit for, the creation in late 1991 of \na Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen (CSPS) attached \nto the Ukrainian Council of Ministers (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 \nJanuary 1992).  Martirosyan was appointed chairman of the new \ncommittee (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992), and Chechylo chief \nof its General Department (Narodnaya Armiya, 11 March 1992). \nMartirosyan told the UOU Executive Committee in January 1992 that \nmilitary housing and other \"social protection\" issues were a \n\"main task\" and \"top priority\" for the UOU and that his dual role \ncreated \"new opportunities\" to solve the problem (Narodnaya \nArmiya, 1 February 1992).  The \"social protection\" issue was a \nmajor topic of discussion at the Third UOU Congress, and \nMartirosyan told the congress that the union was establishing a \nfund to finance housing construction (Moscow radio, 4 April 1992; \nNarodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  In June, the UOU Draft Program \nrepeated that promise (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992).  However, \nthe Third Congress reportedly believed that Martirosyan could not \nadequately lead both the UOU and the CSPS.  Both he and Chechylo \nstepped down from their UOU posts, Martirosyan reportedly under \nheavy pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992). \n   By 1993, the UOU was backing off from its earlier plans to play \nan active role in providing for servicemen's welfare.  In April, \nthe Fourth Congress assailed Martirosyan's stewardship of the \nCSPS, calling for his dismissal but rejecting a call for the \nabolition of the CSPS (Interfax, 12 April 1993; Narodna Armiya, \n13 April 1993).  In May, then-UOU Chairman Skypalskyy said that, \nearlier promises notwithstanding, the union could not help \nfinance housing construction, and would merely offer \"moral \nsupport\" to officers in need of housing (Narodna Armiya, 13 May \n1993).  In contrast to the Third and Fourth Congresses, the Fifth \nUOU Congress in December 1993 was not reported to have discussed \n\"social protection\" at all. \n   Crimea \n   In keeping with its Ukrainian nationalist roots, the UOU opposes \nany change in Crimea's status (Narodnaya Armiya, 9 June 1992). \nThe union and its Crimea regional organization assailed the \nRussian parliament's July 1993 resolution claiming Crimea as \nRussian territory (ITAR-TASS, 1O July 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 28 \nJuly 1993).  In September, the union declared that no bilateral \nissues could be solved until Russia \"surrendered its territorial \nclaims\" (Kiev radio, 2 September 1993).  In December, a Crimean \nUkrainian Civil Congress was created, headed by Lieutenant \nColonel Serhiy Lytvyn, chairman of the UOU Crimea regional \norganization, to lobby for \"preserving Ukraine's territorial \nintegrity.\"  The congress opposed the very holding of a Crimean \npresidential election (Kiev radio, 2 December 1993; Moscow Radio, \n4 December 1993; Holos Ukrayiny, 7 December 1993). \n   Box \n   Allegations of UOU Links to Radical Nationalist Groups \n   Although there have been claims that the UOU is linked to, and is \neven giving active support to, underground armed nationalist \norganizations such as Ukrainian Self-Defense (UNSO) (Moscow News, \n14-21 June 1992; Pravda, 13 May 1993; Valeriy Izmalkov in \nKievskiye Vedomosti, 27 November 1993), Ukrainian news media have \nnot been observed to report hard evidence of such ties.  It \nshould also be noted that these allegations emanate mostly from \nRussian sources or from Ukrainian critics of the UOU.  Former UOU \nChairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy has denied these claims; although \nhe said that the members of UNSO and similar groups were \n\"patriots,\" he also said \"I do not share their methods\" \n(Literaturna Ukrayina, 23 September 1993).  UNSO leader Dmitriy \nKorchinskiy recently told a Moscow News interviewer that UNSO has \nthe support of \"officers' circles,\" but he did not mention the \nUOU or any other organization by name (18-24 February 1994). \n   End Box \n   Appendix B:  Evolution of UOU Policy on Nuclear Weapons \n   The UOU has moved gradually from a position of supporting the \ncountry's denuclearization to one of seeking to retain a \nstrategic nuclear arsenal for some time to come.  The First UOU \nCongress called for a nuclear-free Ukraine (TASS, 29 July 1991). \nThe UOU's first chairman, Vilen Martirosyan, subsequently said \nthat plans for separate Ukrainian armed forces did not include \nany ''strategic'' component, which he said should remain under \ncentral\" control (Kuranty, 29 August 1991).  The Second UOU \nCongress in November 1991 supported this position (Literaturna \nUkrayina, 7 November 1991).  However, the Third UOU Congress \nhailed a statement by Vasyl Durdynets, deputy chairman of the \nUkrainian parliament, that any \"strategic\" forces on Ukrainian \nsoil should be subordinated to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry \n(Moscow Radio, 4 April 1992).  The Fourth UOU Congress called for \nkeeping nuclear weapons in Ukraine (Interfax, 12 April 1992).  At \nthe Fifth UOU Congress, outgoing Chairman Oleksandr Skypalskyy \nspoke in support of the Ukrainian parliament's heavily- \nconditioned ratification in November 1993 of the START I Treaty \nand the Lisbon Protocol (Kiev TV, 18 December 1993).  His \nsuccessor, Oleksandr Rol, recently told an interviewer that he \nbelieved that Ukraine would need a nuclear deterrent for as long \nas Russia possesses nuclear weapons--a position which he has made \npart of his parliamentary election campaign platform.  Rol also \nsaid that, in his capacity as UOU chairman, he would \n\"investigate\" the fact that the officers of the Vinnytsya-based \n43d Missile Army had not sworn allegiance to Ukraine (Za Vilnu \nUkrayinu, 14 January 1994; Shlyakh Peremohy, 29 January 1994). \nThe UOU has issued a statement opposing Ukraine's \"unilateral \nnuclear disarmament\" (Khreshchatyk, 3 March 1994), and the \nunion's local organization in Kiev has called for a nationwide \nreferendum on the subject (Khreshchatyk, 5 March 1994). \n   Appendix C:  Biographical Information \n   The following biographical entries are intended to illustrate the \nUOU's connections with Rukh and other nationalist organizations, \nas well as with the Defense Ministry and other government \ninstitutions.  Russian spellings, where they differ from \nUkrainian, are given in parentheses. \n   Chechylo (Chechilo), Vitaliy, Lt. Col.  He was chairman of Rukh's \nMilitary Collegium; he then served as deputy chairman of the \norganizing committee for the First UOU Congress, where he was \nelected UOU first deputy chairman (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 18 \nSeptember 1991).  He is chief of the General Department of the \nCommittee for Social Protection of Servicemen attached to the \nUkrainian Council of Ministers (Narodnaya Armiya, 11 March 1992). \nHe stepped down from his UOU post at the Third Congress \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 28 March 1992).  He has since been feuding \nwith the union's leadership, accusing it of corruption (Pravda, \nUkrayiny, 21 December 1992).  Former UOU Chairman Oleksandr \nSkypalskyy called his criticisms \"ignoble and ungentlemanly,\" \nclaiming that he had not been expelled only because the union had \nno expulsion procedure (Narodna Armiya, 13 May 1993). \n   Haysynskyy (Gaysinskiy), Andriy, Lt.  A UOU deputy chairman (Za \nVilnu Ukrayinu, 2O September 1991), he served on the commission \nto organize the Defense Ministry Socio-Psychological Service \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July 1992). \n   Kostyuk, Roman, Col., reserves.  He was chairman of the UOU Kiev \norganization in 1992 (Narodnaya Armiya, 1 February 1992) and then \nUOU first deputy chairman (Narodna Hazeta No. 44, November 1993). \nHe helped draft the 1991 legislation setting up the Ukrainian \nArmed Forces (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992).  He was one of the \nsigners, along with Rukh's Vyacheslav Chornovil, of a \nProclamation of the Standing Council of Democratic Parties and \nMovements of Ukraine, calling for unity in the March 1994 \nparliamentary election campaign (Khreshchatyk, 11 December 1993). \n   Krychun, Vasyl.  A former member of the Soviet Air Defense \nForces, he is now a member of both the oblast and city soviets, \nas well as head of the city communal property fund, in Ivano- \nFrankivsk.  A member of Rukh since 1989, he is also deputy \nchairman of the UOU Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast organization and a \ncandidate in the March 1994 election for parliament (Halychyna, \n12 February 1994). \n   Kubakh, M.F., Lt. Col., reserves.  A deputy UOU chairman for \neconomic affairs and a member of the Kharkiv Oblast Soviet \nmilitary commission, he was one of the authors of the UOU Draft \nProgram (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992). \n   Lazorkin, V, Col., member of the Lviv Oblast Soviet (Narodnaya \nArmiya, 22 January 1992). He served as UOU deputy chairman \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and chairman of the UOU \nCoordinating Council (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 July 1992).  He helped \ndraft the 1991 legislation setting up Ukrainian Armed Forces \n(Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992) and was one of the authors of \nthe UOU Draft Program (Narodnaya Armiya, 4 June 1992). \n   Lytvyn (Litvin), Serhiy, Lt. Col., retired.  Chairman of the UOU \nCrimean regional organization and chairman of the Ukrainian \nStudies Department at the Symferopil Higher Building School, he \nwas elected chairman of the new Crimean Ukrainian Civil Congress \nin December 1993, at which time he retired from active military \nduty (Holos Ukrayiny, 7 December 1993). \n   Martirosyan, Vilen, Maj. Gen.  A member of Rukh's Political \nCouncil, he was elected the UOU's first chairman at its First \nCongress in July 1991 (TASS, 29 July 1991).  He served as \nchairman until the Third Congress in April 1992, when he stepped \ndown under pressure (Narodnaya Armiya, 8 April 1992), and \nsubsequently left the UOU altogether (Narodna Armiya, 13 May \n1993).  He recently authored a scathing attack on the UOU, \nclaiming that under Volodymyr Mulyava's leadership it had \ninstigated an \"open purge\" of the officer corps in favor of then- \nDefense Minister Konstyantyn Morozov's supporters, which \naccording to Martirosyan has resulted in a wholesale exodus of \nhighly skilled servicemen, both officers and enlisted men \n(Kievskiye Vedomosti, 5 February 1994).  He has been chairman of \nthe Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen, attached to \nthe Ukrainian Council of Ministers, since its creation in \nDecember 1991 (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 January 1992; Kievskiye \nVedomosti, 5 February 1994).  He is an ethnic Armenian (Narodnaya \nArmiya, 4 April 1992). \n   Mulyava, Volodymyr.  Mulyava's only military rank prior to \nJanuary 1992 was sergeant in the reserves (Moskovskiye Novosti, \n10 November 1992).  He developed his ideas for a military Socio- \nPsychological Service to inculcate Ukrainian patriotism among \nservicemen as early as 1986, and was active in Rukh's 1990 and \n1991 preparations to organize the UOU (Narodnaya Armiya, 29 July \n1992).  A deputy chairman of Rukh's governing board, he chaired \nthe organizing committee for the First UOU Congress and was \nelected UOU deputy chairman (Kiev radio, 27 July 1991; Rabochaya \nTribuna, 2 August 1991).  In September 1991, he submitted a \nreport on behalf of Rukh to Ukraine's new defense minister, \nKonstyantyn Morozov, proposing to create a Socio-Psychological \nService.  Morozov gave Mulyava the rank of colonel and appointed \nhim to head a commission to organize the new service (Narodnaya \nArmiya, 29 July 1992).  In February 1992, Mulyava was appointed \nhead of the service (Syn Otechestva No. 7, February 1992).  He \nalso sat on the Defense Ministry Higher Certification Commission. \nAt the end of 1992, he was promoted to major general (Narodnaya \nArmiya, 3 December 1992).  In late 1993, Mulyava was removed from \nthe Socio-Psychological Service and appointed deputy minister for \nties with the public, parties, and movements, a shift which was \nseen as weakening his and the UOU's influence since his new \nposition gave him no role in personnel or indoctrination (Holos \nUkrayiny, 12, 17 November 1993).  He was also removed from the \nHigher Certification Commission (UNIAR, 2 December 1993). \nMulyava has served as Rukh spokesman on economic policy (Narodna \nHazeta, No. 1, January 1992) and on Ukrainian Orthodox Church \naffairs (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 June 1992) and is the hetman of \nthe Ukrainian Cossacks (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 4 March 1993; Kiev \nradio, 18 August 1993).  He is a candidate in the March 1994 \nelection for parliament (Halychyna, 27 January 1994). \n   Omelchenko, Hryhoriy.  Formerly a career MVD officer (Narodna \nArmiya, 13 May 1993), Omelchenko is now a colonel in the \nUkrainian Security Service, where he heads the organized crime \nunit of the Military Counterintelligence Directorate \n(Nezavisimost, 9 April 1993).  He is also a member of the Defense \nMinistry Higher Certification Commission (Narodnaya Armiya, 30 \nJanuary 1993).  Omelchenko was a deputy chairman of the UOU until \nits Third Congress in April 1992, when he was elected chairman \n(Narodna Armiya, 8 April 1992).  He served as chairman until the \nFourth Congress a year later, when he was again elected deputy \nchairman (Kiev radio, 15 September 1993); he was re-elected to \nthat post at the Fifth Congress (Molod Ukrayiny, 24 December \n1993).  He is a candidate for parliament on the ticket of the \nDemocratic Revival of Ukraine Party (UNIAR, 29 December 1993). \n   Pylypchuk (Pilipchuk), Volodymyr, Colonel.

Gen.  Chief of the Defense Ministry \nMilitary Education Directorate (Golos Ukrainy, 15 January 1993). \nThough not reported to be a UOU member, he co-authored, with UOU \ndeputy chairmen Volodymyr Mulyava and Hryhoriy Omelchenko, an \narticle accusing Lieutenant General Boris Sharykov, then military \nadviser to President Kravchuk, of corruption, pro-communist and \npro-Russian sympathies, and disloyalty to Ukraine (Narodnaya \nArmiya, 3 June 1992).  He was removed from the Defense Ministry \nHigher Certification Commission by Defense Minister Vitaliy \nRadetskyy (UNIAN, 2 December 1993). \n   Rol (Ryl), Oleksandr, Maj. Gen.  Once a senior Soviet Air Force \nofficer, Rol is now chief of the Operational Administration Staff \nof the Ukrainian Air Force (Samostiyna Ukrayina, 5 February \n1994).  He has persistently criticized the leadership of the \nUkrainian Defense Ministry for inefficiency and corruption and \nhas called for a robust Ukrainian military, including offensive \nas well as defensive capabilities (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 17 March \n1992; Ukrinform, 3 March 1993; Vechirniy Kyyiv, 13 October 1993; \nZa Vilnu Ukrayinu, 8 February 1994).  He recently endorsed \nUkrainian retention of nuclear weapons (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu, 14 \nJanuary 1994).

A \nmember of the UOU Executive Committee until April 1993, he was \nelected UOU chairman at the Fourth Congress (Narodna Armiya, 13 \nApril 1993).  He stepped down at the Fifth Congress in December \n1993 to run for parliament (Vechirniy Kyyiv, 21 December 1993). \nWith Oleksandr Yemets, leader of the Party of Democratic Revival \nof Ukraine, he was one of the founders of the Democratic Center \nelectoral bloc for the March 1994 election (Kievskiye Vedomosti, \n12 January 1994). \n   Saladyak (Solodyak), Volodymyr, Col., retired.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n                                        Apparently seeing little merit in a policy of open confrontation \nwith the Chinese over human rights issues and at the same time \neager to secure a share of China's burgeoning market, Germany and \nFrance have avoided all but the most muted public criticism of \nChina's human rights record while steadily expanding diplomatic \nand trade contacts.  German and French media, while supportive of \nimproved relations with China, have expressed doubts about the \nwisdom of sof t-pedaling the human rights issue and yielding to \nChina's demand to stop selling arms to Taiwan. \n                                     END SUMMARY \n   In marked contrast to recent U.S. policy, both Germany and France \nhave chosen a low-key approach to the issue of Chinese human \nrights violations, arguing that it is more effective to promote \ndemocratic development through strengthened economic relations \nthan through public admonitions.  Germany's efforts, including \nlifting sanctions against China and yielding to China's \ninsistence that it not sell submarines to Taiwan, culminated in \nChancellor Helmut Kohl's trip to China in November 1993 and the \nsigning of several large contracts.  Similarly, following months \nof diplomatic efforts to repair a rift in relations triggered by \nFrance's sale of Mirage airplanes to Taiwan in November 1992, \nFrance and China \"normalized\" relations on 12 January.  In return \nfor two key French concessions--recognition of the PRC Government \nas the \"sole legal government of China\" and Taiwan as an \n\"integral part of Chinese territory\" and agreement \"not to \nauthorize\" any French enterprises to sell arms to Taiwan--China \nagreed to welcome participation by French firms in China \"on an \nequal footing,\" according to a joint communique (Xinhua, 12 \nJanuary). \n   Germany's \"Quiet Diplomacy\" \n   German leaders have repeatedly defended the government's policy \nof not pressuring the Chinese publicly on human rights and \ninstead promoting change through economic relations and \"behind- \nthe-scenes\" efforts.  Both Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel \nhave stressed that Germany's approach on Chinese human rights is \nto use quiet diplomacy and to promote progress on human rights \nand democracy in China through trade and economic reform: \n   --Even after the recent roundup of Chinese dissidents, the German \nreaction was limited to an expression of \"concern\" over the \narrests, and a caution issued by a foreign ministry spokesman \nthat the arrests could \"clearly disturb\" German-Chinese \nrelations.  Indicating that even in this case the usual German \nnonpublic diplomacy was being followed, the spokesman said Berlin \nhad \"approached\" Beijing on this matter the previous week (DPA, 8 \nMarch). \n   --Explaining Germany's approach to the human rights issue, Kinkel \ntold German ambassadors to Asia on 26 January that \"wagging an \nadmonishing finger\" at the Chinese would not be productive, \nbecause Europeans cannot \"impose\" their cultural principles on \nthe Asian countries.  \"Dignity,\" so important in Asia, he said, \nhad to be respected.  He argued that instead of public \nconfrontation, it would be more effective to be \"secretly active\" \nto help in concrete cases of human rights violations (Frankfurter \nRundschau, 27 January).  Apparently with the United States in \nmind, Kinkel contrasted Germany's approach to those who \"bang \ntheir fists on the table,\" and declared that the West \"cannot \nenforce everything\" with pressure on the leadership (Das \nParlament, 24-31 December 1993). \n   --During his trip to China, Kohl defended his approach on human \nrights, saying that he had had an \"intensive talk on human \nrights\" with China's leaders but that it was \"not a subject\" for \npublic discussion (N-TV, 19 November 1993). \"History has shown,\" \nhe argued in another interview, that \"freedom leads to more \nfreedom\" and that free economic development \"has an impact on \nhuman rights and the freedom of the citizens\" (ARD, 19 November \n1993). \n   German Press Questions Policy \n   Until the arrest of Chinese dissidents in early March, media \nreaction had been largely supportive of the Government's trade \ninitiatives in China and its low-key approach to the human rights \nissue.  The Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung even said in a 25 \nJanuary commentary that Kohl and Kinkel's efforts on human rights \ncould \"serve as a model\" for dealing with China, because they \ndemonstrated that \"value-oriented\" foreign policy does \"not have \nto be an exercise in finger-pointing.\"  Since the largescale \narrests, however, the press has questioned this policy, \ncriticizing both Germany and the United States for acceding to \nChina's demands and suggesting that the West's approach is giving \nBeijing every reason to believe that the West will do nothing to \njeopardize trade relations: \n   --Following the arrest of prominent Chinese dissidents in early \nMarch, the influential daily Frankfurter Allgemeine on 5 March \nsaid the Chinese Government had shown what it thought of Western \ncriticism:  namely, \"nothing.\"  \"For the sake of economic \ninterests\" the West will continue to turn a \"blind eye\" to the \npolitical suppression in China and even more so in Tibet, because \nthe Chinese market is \"too enticing.\"  Europe's argument that the \n\"closer the economic ties,\" the greater the chances for \n\"political loosening up,\" has proved \"illusionary.\" \n   --On 17 February, Frankfurter Allgemeine chastized the German \nGovernment for the \"shameful\" way in which the city of Frankfurt \nhad officially \"invited and then uninvited\" the Tibetan Dalai \nLama to a celebration of Frankfurt's 1,200th anniversary, calling \nthe move an \"unnecessary kowtow\" and an \"undignified retreat\" in \nthe face of China's unreasonable demands. \n   --The left-of-center Frankfurter Rundschau of 5 March said that \n\"just as during Kohl's trip\" to China, Beijing seems to have come \nto the conclusion that \"all western admonitions\" on human rights \nare meant \"halfheartedly.\" \n   France Pleased \n   In announcing renewed relations with China, Foreign Minister \nAlain Juppe avoided any mention of human rights issues, while \nsaying that the \"political weight of China and its economic \npower\" justified France's decision to \"resume the ties of trust.\" \nHe expressed hope that this could be brought about through an \n\"intense political dialogue with Beijing\" and \"strengthening of \neconomic relations\" (France-Inter Radio, 12 January). \n   Although they avoided pressing the Chinese on the issue, French \nleaders apparently did mention human rights in subsequent \nmeetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.  Following a \nmeeting with Qian in Paris on 22 January, Juppe spoke of a \"new \ndeparture\" in relations with China, saying that he had addressed \nthe issue of human rights with Qian and that \"a lot must still be \ndone\" by China in that area (AFP, 22 January).  France's special \nenvoy to China Alain Peyrefitte addressed the issue \"with great \nsubtlety\" according to Le Figaro of 31 January, when he said at \ndinner with Qian in China that France, while it was unwilling to \n\"impinge on a sovereign state's internal affairs,\" could \"not be \ninsensitive to matters relating to the respect of individual and \ngroup freedoms.\" \n   Skeptical French Press \n   The French press has criticized the government's failure to press \nthe human rights issue, and has largely been skeptical of \nprospects for significantly improved trade relations.  Several \ncommentaries attacked the government for yielding to China's \ndemands on Taiwan and expressed pique at what they viewed as \nChina's favoritism toward the United States, which they saw as \nhaving maintained relations with Taiwan without incurring Chinese \nretribution. \n   --The influential daily Le Monde was particularly skeptical.  An \neditorial on 14 January expressed doubt about the terms of the \njoint communique, saying that the Chinese have shown \"how little \nregard\" they attach to their promises of trade advantages.  As \nfor human rights, it charged, Beijing is \"convinced that \n'hypocritical' Western concerns for human rights\" will eventually \nbe superseded by greed.  On 25 January, Le Monde wrote \nsardonically that normalization of relations with China indeed \nrepresented a \"new departure,\" since \"commercial interests\" had \nnow \"displaced the memory of the Tiananmen massacre,\" which the \nFrench government at the time had denounced with a determination \n\"unmatched throughout the world.\" \n   --A commentary published in Liberation of 16 February charged the \nFrench Government with \"obsequiousness\" and \"grovelling\" toward \nBeijing in pledging not to sell weapons to Taiwan.  China's \nrulers \"do not respect the rules\" accepted by the international \ncommunity with regard to human rights, weapons sales, or external \ntrade, the commentary said, noting that the United States \nremained the \"only country that still dares to say no to China\" \n(Liberation, 16 February). \n(AUTHOR: SHAVER.

Concerning the price of \npublic urban, interurban, and railway transportation tickets, the \nministry has specified a possible increase in tariffs, viewing the \nfuel price rise and the recent wage increase as a possible rise in \ninflation.  The Transports Ministry has envisaged a 40-percent \nincrease in public transportation fares.  Godo states that the price \nof monthly public transportation cards will also be increased.  The \nticket for an urban bus service will be five leks instead of three, \nthus denoting a 40-percent increase.  While the price of a monthly \ncard will be 24-30 percent higher.  The train ticket fares will be \nabout 30-40 percent lower than the price offered by private buses or \ncars.  Consequently, the state will cover losses in public urban and \nrailway transportation to the amount of 350 million leks per year. \n(Tirana ATA in English 1113 GMT 28 Jan 94 AU) \n   DISTRIBUTION OF 2,000 CHINESE MINITRACTORS:  The Ministry of \nAgriculture and Food reports that on 24 January, 2,000 Chinese \nmini tractors, which reached Durres port on 15-17 January, were \ndistributed to 11 private service centers in various districts of \nthe country.  Ismail Bega, agricultural mechanisms director, stated \nthat the mini tractors were sold to private farmers, mainly in \nnorthern areas, through four-year loans granted by the Agrarian \nTrade Bank at a 5-percent annual interest rate.  The Albanian \nGovernment bought these mini tractors in China at the cost of $4.4 \nmillion to encourage local agricultural production.  Despite the \npoverty prevailing in the Albanian countryside, peasants bought the \nmini tractors in a short period of time, thus showing that the \nAlbanian agricultural market badly needs agricultural facilities. \n   Land privatization, which was 92 percent completed by the end of \n1993, brought about the use of that part of the land that for \nvarious reasons remained untilled during the last two years.  A \ntotal of 9,000 agricultural appliances are presently functioning in \nthe Albanian agriculture that counts 400,000 peasant families, each \npossessing a little more than one hectare of land.  Thanks to loans \ngranted by the Albanian State Bank and various banks, and through \nprivate traders as well, during the last two years some 1,600 \ntractors and 2,250 minitractors and cultivators have been brought to \nAlbania from Germany, Italy, Britain, Greece, and other countries. \n(Tirana ATA in English 1125 GMT 29 Jan 94 AU) \n   SAUDI FIRM TO INVEST $100 MILLION:  RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE reports \ntoday that the Saudi Arabian Holding Company will make an investment \nof $100 million in the fields of industry and agriculture in \nAlbania.

Every worker will receive 5,100 leks for three \nmonths with the condition that the firm's owner will employ 70 \npercent of the workers trained there.  The same practice will also \nbe followed in a construction firm.  At present, some 16,200 persons \nare receiving social assistance in Berat.  This figure has increased \nbecause the Textile Mill products are not being sold, so many \ntextile workers have become jobless and are receiving assistance. \n(Tirana ATA in English 1123 GMT 31 Jan 94 AU) \n   STATE EMPLOYEES TO GET 'SIGNIFICANT' WAGE INCREASE:  Starting \nwith 1 February, employees of budgetary institutions will have a \nsalary increase of 33 percent.  Based on the decision by the \nMinistry of Labor and Emigration, a higher rise in wages is \nanticipated for senior state officials and institutions, including \ndeputies.  This is the second year that the budgetary employees have \nreceived a significant salary rise.  The 1993 minimal wages, \nincluding the auxiliary sectors of state administration, will have a \nl00-percent increase, thus a monthly salary of 2,400 leks.  However, \nthe minimum wage will be 1O times lower than the highest wage in the \nbudgetary sector.  Both the rise and differentiation in salaries is \nmade considering qualifications and positions in organizing and \nmanaging all state structures.  The decision on the salary rise came \nimmediately after the Albanian Parliament approved the decision on \ntaxes on personal incomes.  This decision does not cover monthly \npayments up to 4,000 leks and pensions.

Commission Chairman Shemedin Buci said that \"we are \nfacing many difficulties, although instructions have been very \nclear.  In some cases, two or three persons have claimed the same \nsite.  That is why we have been cooperating with the district \ncourt.\"  Main reasons for the slowness in this process were the \nconflicts between the Town Planning Department and former owners who \ninsist on taking the site pertaining to them, despite the town \nregulatory plan.  Another reason was also the uncontrolled sale of \nthe buildings without first notifying their former owners.

They are \nconcentrated in central Albania in the region of Elbasan, where \nthere are 21 of them, and in Lushnje, where 10 associations are now \noperating.  Their number is limited in the north of the country, \nwhich is a mountainous area with limited land and populated by \npeople with a strong feeling for land ownership.  The area that a \nfarmers association covers is approximately 750 hectares.  The \nestablishment of these associations has enabled the farmers to buy \nagricultural facilities and fertilizers and employ their family \nmembers in them.  A great number of families have now become members \nof these associations.  The Farmers Association of Kercukaj in \nKavaje, central Albania, has 300 families as members, whereas the \nFarmers Association in Lac has 246 member-families.

A further \ndemand was for permission to export timber directly from Komi to \nthird markets. \n   Khristo Todorov, head of the Forestry Committee, said that at the \nnegotiations in September 1993 an agreement was reached with the \nRussian experts.  However, in November Moscow said that the \nBulgarian demands were unjustified.  He added that beginning in \nApril the enterprises in Usogorsk and Gorniy Mezen will gradually be \nshut down.  Two other joint Bulgarian-Russian enterprises in \nBlagoevo and Mezhdurechensk will also shut down in mid-June, as it \nhas become impossible to continue their self-financing and self- \nmaintenance under the current Bulgarian-Russian agreement.  The \n4,600 people currently employed at the four enterprises will have to \nseek other jobs as of September 1994. \n   \"Before 1991 we used to process 3.6 million cubic meters of \ntimber in Komi.

He added that the cessation of timber \nsupplies from Komi will not cause a crisis in the Bulgarian timber- \nprocessing industry, as domestic timber production will satisfy \nlocal needs.  However, talks on joint timber production could \ncontinue and an agreement could still be reached, he said.

According to \nBenda, the ministry will seek ways of stopping the current \nsituation.  This situation has arisen due to lax border checks and \ndue to the fact that some raw materials are exported as construction \nsupplies.

The environment \nministry' objective was to reach a compromise during the talks with \nVladimir Dlouhy, minister of industry and trade, on reducing export \nquotas, Benda said.

He went on to say that \nthe CSA management was responsible for CSA's problems, and now the \nCzech side was seeking the culprit elsewhere.

Jiri Fleischhans, deputy director of the Nuclear \nand Physical Engineering Faculty at the Czech Technical University, \nsaid experts have already pondered over the problem.  However, 80 \npercent of the completed structure would have to remain unused.  Gas \nto run the plant would require the entire capacity of a standard \npipeline.  A strategic decision of whether to rely on one supplier \nfor such a source of power would also have to be taken.  Fleischhans \nsaid that a large gas-fired plant would likely be more efficient and \nwould thus release about one-third less steam, which is believed to \ncause global warming.  On the other hand, emissions of carbon \ndioxide would be greater.  He noted that cost estimates are not \navailable for a project of this size.  Temelin is expected to be put \ninto operation between 1996 and 1997.

The \nAV RT has already drawn up a plan for the privatization of large \nbanks under which the privatization of the Hungarian Commercial Bank \n(MKB) and Budapest Bank has been launched.  In accordance with this \nconcept, the first stage is to find professional strategic \ninvestors.  The second stage is the involvement of owners with long- \nterm interests such as local and foreign insurance companies, \npension funds, and investment companies.  Finally, the third stage \ninvolves the banks' introduction onto the Budapest Stock Exchange \n(BSE). \n   AV RT's plan sets the stake of strategic investors in the banks \nat 30 to 50 percent, that of financial investors at 2 to 10 percent, \nthat of employees and management at 5 to 10 percent, and that of \nsmall investors at 5 to 20 percent.

Computer industry \nin Hungary began to take shape at the beginning of the l98Os -- a \nperiod when computer scientists could start their own enterprises, \nmainly focusing on software development.  Their small firms have \nbeen expanding and are the leading companies today (for example \nMicrosystem, Controll, Rolitron), while subsidized research centers \nhave had to close down one after another because their specialists \nrealized they could earn more in business enterprises. \n   In the 1990's, the liberalization of import conditions and the \nlifted western embargo resulted in a multitude of small firms, most \nof which became personal computer dealers without any adequate \nbackground for service.  Many a leading firm found its prices too \nlow to compete with them and went bankrupt.  Meanwhile many powerful \nWestern firms appeared in Hungary (IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Epson). \nTheir share of the market has been gradually increasing due to the \ndirect distribution of products and professional service network. \nAt present computer industry and trade in Hungary can be divided \ninto three main areas.  There are 2OO to 300 small firms selling \ncheap, mainly Taiwanese hardware.  There are about 10 Hungarian \ncompanies mostly involved in such services as building computer \nnetworks, maintaining computer service shops, and teaching computer \nsciences.  The third group consists of some multinational firms \nselling both hardware and software, and also having well-developed \nservice networks. \n   By 1993, hardware development in Hungary almost came to an end. \nThere are only a few experts dealing even with special software \ndevelopment because multinational firms offer almost complete \nprogram packages to customers in each professional field.  Hungary, \nfollowing the Western market tendency, has entered a period of \nrecession in computer business, some experts claim.  Hewlett-Packard \nis said to possess one-sixth of the Hungarian computer market and is \nprepared to face a continuous recession ending only in 1995. \nEstablished in Hungary three years ago with 72 employees, Hewlett- \nPackard made an income of HUF3 billion, or $30 million, in 1993. \nThe European marketing manager of the firms expects a 10 percent \nfall of income by 1996.  The cause of decreasing prices both on the \ninternational and Hungarian market is standardization, a phenomenon \nexpected also in software business.  The 1993 results, however, for \nexample the 121 percent rise of turnover on the Hungarian market, do \nnot indicate the penetration of world-market recession into Hungary. \n(Budapest MTI in English 0719 GMT 8 Feb 94 AU) \n   CENTRAL EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA:  Creating a Central European \nFree Trade Area (CEFTA) helps the countries concerned catch up with \nWestern Europe because it stimulates their economic growth and \ntransformation into market economies, Minister of International \nEconomic Relations Bela Kadar Said.  In Kadar's view, sound economic \ncooperation is the best tool for stabilizing Central Europe.  Owing \nto the free trade agreement which came into force on March 1 last \nyear, half of trade among the four countries has been liberalized by \nnow.  According to Kadar, trade among the countries concerned will \nbe almost entirely liberalized by 1998.

In 1993, gross earnings grew by 25 percent on \naverage.  The increase was 21.1 percent for blue-collar workers and \n27.2 percent for white-collar employees.  Real earnings dropped by \n1.6 percent in 1993.  Last year the average gross monthly earnings \nfor employees working in firms with a staff of over 20 amounted to \nHUF28,243 -- 25.6 percent more than in 1992.  The net monthly income \nof full-time employees was HUF18,901 -- 20.6 percent over the 1992 \nfigure.  Major wage increases in December were registered only in \nthe financial and mining sectors.

This is the \nfirst time the unemployment figure has risen since February last \nyear, when it stood at 705,000.  From the start of this year, the \ncalculation of the unemployment rate is based on Central Statistical \nOffice (KSH) estimates of the total working-age population in 1993 \nand not in 1992.  As a result, the unemployment rate is 0.5 percent \nhigher (12.8 percent) in January.  The highest rate (21.1 percent) \nwas registered in Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen county, the second highest \n(20.6 percent) in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, and the third highest \n(19.1 percent) in Nograd.  The unemployment rate was relatively low \n(6.3 percent) in Budapest.  Using the same basis for calculation as \nlast year, the unemployment rate was 12.3 percent in January.  The \nnumber of first-time job seekers continued to fall in January. \n47,300 people lost their jobs in January and 36,900 people were \ntaken off the list of registered unemployed.  22,800 new jobs were \navailable in January, 40 percent more than in January, and the total \nnumber of job vacancies grew by 3,200 to around 51,000.

Bod said the bank strives to \nencourage domestic savings and thereby intends to cover the \ngovernment's credit needs and to create the ever increasing amounts \nneeded for local industry operation. \n   The Hungarian budget law makes it possible for the Finance \nMinistry to issue state bonds with longer than one-year maturities \nin a value of 300 billion forints to cover the planned deficit of \n329.56 billion forints (compared to the budget deficit of 199.7 \nbillion forints last year), and to raise the Treasury Bill Stock by \n29.56 billion forints to refinance the deficit.  Hungary is issuing \nbonds on the international money market at more or less regular \nintervals as the so-called risk surcharge on Hungarian bonds has \nrecently declined significantly.  When the country reappeared on the \ninternational market in 1991, it was ranked in the 300-point \ncategory in the European points system, which serves as the basis \nfor the risk surcharge.  Today, Hungary has to reckon with a risk \nsurcharge that accords to only 160 to 170 points, Bod said.  He \nadded that the pace of raising further loans depends on direct \nforeign investments.  \"If the value of these remains at around $1.5 \nto 2 billion, then we shall continue to be forced to raise loans,\" \nBod said.

Ninety percent of the losses were posted by the \nmanufacturing sector.  Half of the industrial-companies which do \nmake profits account for 60 percent of industrial output.  They \nemploy less than 50 percent of the industrial workforce.

This includes a total of 99 billion \nforints for 1992 credit consolidation programs and, in 1993, 114 \nbillion forints for the bank consolidation program, and 57 billion \nforints for debtor consolidation.  A capital injection of an \nestimated 20 billion to 30 billion forints is necessary in order for \nthe banks involved in the second stage of the bank consolidation \nprogram to achieve a capital adequacy ratio of 4 percent.  The \ngovernment has spent 13 billion forints on the consolidation of the \nHungarian Railways (MAV), 6 billion forints on a capital injection \nfor savings cooperatives, 4 billion forints on debt relief for \ndrought affected companies, and 1 billion forints on the repayment \nof soil improvement loans to banks.  It is seen to be unfortunate \nthat the stakes owned by the state in banks were in the hands of \ndifferent state institutions.  It was time to draw up contracts \nbetween the Finance Ministry and the Hungarian State Holding Company \n(AV RT) on the handling of these stakes.

The company has \norders for only 250,000 tons of bauxite in the first three months of \nthis year.  The company now employs 1,800, compared with 3,000 in \n1988, when it mined 3 million tons of bauxite.  Some 1.7 million \ntons of bauxite was mined in Hungary in 1992, and 550,000 tons of \nalumina and 27,000 tons of aluminum were produced.  Although the \nsame amount of aluminum was produced last year, production of \nalumina and extraction of bauxite fell 10-15 percent.  At present, \nHUNGALU's three alumina plants (in Ajka, Mosonmagyarovar, and \nAlmasfuzito) are still in operation but it now has only one \naluminium smelter (in Inota) following the closure of smelters in \nTatabanya and Ajka three years ago.

The three together now hold 29.8 \npercent of Danubius Rt's 8 billion forints registered capital. \n   CA Securities stood on both sides of the 2.38 billion forints \ndeal in Danubius shares on 28 January, as it was commissioned to \nsell by the State Property Agency (AVU) and Danubius Hotels Rt. \nwhile also acting for the three U.S. purchasers.  In the 28 January \ntransaction, AVU sold a 26 percent stake in Danubius, while the \nremaining 3.8 percent stake sold was held by Danubius itself.  The \nAVU still holds a 10 percent stake in Danubius Rt. which will be \neventually offered in exchange for compensation coupons.  34.7 \npercent of Danubius's equity is in the hands of small investors, \n10.6 percent is owned by local councils and 7.5 percent by \nemployees.

(Budapest MTI in English 1534 GMT 1 \nFeb 94 AU) \n   STATE OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS:  Central Statistical Office \nfigures show that infrastructure was a crucial area of the national \neconomy in 1993.  Over the first nine months of last year, 90.9 \nbillion forints ($900 million), or 37 percent of the total \ninvestment spending, was channelled into transport, storage, post, \nand telecommunications, as well as electricity, gas, heat, and water \nsupply.  The volume of overall investments, in real terms, was the \nsame as in 1992, while that of infrastructure projects increased. \nThe fastest development is in the telephone system.  Last year, 1.3 \nmillion main stations operated in the country, 4O percent more than \nin 1989.  The over 500,000 applicants waitlisted at the end of 1993 \nhave all been promised a telephone by 1997.  To accelerate the \nprocess, the government allowed each local municipality, meeting \ndozens of concession requests, to set up a telephone distribution \nsystem.  Privatization of the Hungarian Telecommunications Co. last \nDecember mobilized foreign capital worth $875 million for the \npurpose.  Over 90 percent of the main stations were connected to the \ndirect distance dialing system, which is planned to be completed \nnationwide by 1997.  (The 1989 ratio was 85.5 percent.) \n   The national road system last year measured 30,800 kilometers. \nThis compared to 30,000 in 1992.  Construction of the M1 highway \nfrom Gyor in western Hungary to the Austrian border began last year \nand will be completed in 1995.  (It presently covers the 150-km \ndistance between Budapest and Gyor.)  The M15, leading to Bratislava \nand Prague via Mosonmagyarovar, will be opened to traffic in 1997, \nwith the new section of the MO, around the capital, opening this \nautumn.  Beginning this year, the M3 speedway, currently 80 \nkilometers long, is being built further towards northeastern \nHungary, but will not reach the border by the time of the 1996 \nBudapest World Expo.  The large cities of the region -- Debrecen, \nMiskolc, Nyiregyhaza -- will be linked to it from the National Road \nFund.  The southern motorway towards Serbia will be completed up to \nKecskemet, central Hungary, with two lanes by 1996.  The M7 motoway \nrunning across Transdanubia by Lake Balaton at a length of 90 \nkilometers, will be extended in the direction of Croatia and \nSlovenia. \n   These projects will be carried out on a concession basis.  M1 \nwill be built by a French-Austrian-Hungarian consortium in \ncooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment (EBRD), and M7 with Italian participation as part of the \nTrieste-Kiev axis.  The European Union also supports development of \nHungary's southern and eastern transit routes and the extension of \nthe northern Hungarian section of the Polish-Slovak-Hungarian road \nsystem.  Six towns will receive bypasses from state and local \nauthority finances.  Utilizing the state road fund, 443 towns and \nvillages built 103 kilometers of road and 177 kilometers of cycle \ntrack last year.  Regional projects are also given foreign \nassistance.  For example, several border posts have been set up with \naid from the European Union's PHARE (Economic Reconstruction Aid for \nPoland and Hungary) scheme.  The World Bank and the EBRD have \ngranted 17 billion forints ($170 million) for the reconstruction of \ntramways and an underground line in Budapest.  Both transport and \ncommunal infrastructure projects are expected to narrow the gap \nbetween regions with varying degrees of development. \n   So far, the various counties have spent state support, granted \nunder a regional development program, on different sectors of their \ninfrastructure:  The drinking water supply and roads in Nograd, the \ntelephone network in Borsod, both in northern Hungary, and the gas \nprogram in the eastern county of Szabolcs-Szatmar.  Public utilities \nare expanding at an accelerated rate.  The length of water mains \nlast year exceeded 55,300 kilometers, of which 4,000 were built over \nthe past four years.  At present, 89 percent of towns and villages \nhave conduit water supply, reaching 3.6 million households, or more \nthan four-fifths of the total.  Full-scale supply is planned for \n1997.  Drainage measured 16,300 kilometers in 1993, with 1,900 \nkilometers built during the last three years.  Thus, 17 percent of \ntowns and villages and nearly 38 percent of households -- 1.7 \nmillion -- are connected to the drainage system.  Of the 600 towns \nand villages (18 percent) supplied with gas last year, 172 have been \nconnected to the system since 1989.  The 30,000-kilometer-long pipe \nnetwork carries gas to 40 percent of the households, numbering 1.8 \nmillion.

Overall output in the \nconstruction industry in the first nine months was the same as in \nthe comparable period of 1992 but house construction in January- \nNovember was 16 percent down on the first eleven months of 1992. \nSales of farm produce were down 24 percent in the first 11 months of \nlast year as compared with January-November 1992.  Preliminary \nfigures show a grain harvest of 8.4 million tons last year, 13 \npercent less than in 1992, the sugar beet harvest down 24 percent, \nand the sunflower seed harvest down 11 percent.  Livestock numbers \nfor all kinds of farm animals were lower in September 1993 than a \nyear earlier. \n   Consumer prices rose 22.5 percent in the whole of 1993. \nIndustrial producer prices rose 10.8 percent in the first 11 months \nand agricultural producer prices rose 25.3 percent in the 12 months \nup to the end of November.  The total personal cash income in the \nfirst 11 months was 18 percent higher than in the same period of \n1992, which represents a fall of 3 to 4 percent in real terms.  The \ntotal gross wage income in the first 11 months was 25.5 percent up \nand the net wage income 20.5 percent up on the corresponding period \nof the previous year.  The workforce of companies with more than 20 \nemployees was on average 9 percent lower in the first 11 months than \nin January-November 1992.

In \n1993, grain crops totalled 8.4 million tons, 1.3 million tons less \nthan in 1992 and 5.5 million tons less than the average of 1986- \n1990.  Cereals yielded 4.4 million tons in 1993, 19 percent less \nthan in 1992, despite the area sown being 7 percent larger.  The \nsown area of wheat grew by 17 percent but the average crop fell by \n25 percent per hectare.  The sown area of maize shrank by 2 percent \ncompared with 1992 and its yield by 5 percent.  Sugar beet grews on \nan area 9,000 hectares smaller than in 1992, and the crop fell by 18 \npercent per hectare.  Sunflower crops dropped by over 10 percent, \npotato crops by 22 percent.  According to the report, besides \ndrought, the low average of crops was due to a drop in the use of \nartificial fertilizers.  Fertilizers used on one hectare were under \n40 kgs, compared to 180-200 kgs in previous years.

Szabo says, in 1994, the output of \nagriculture is to increase by 5 to 8 percent, within that, plant \ncultivation by 14 to 20 percent, while animal husbandry is expected \nto stagnate.  Production of the food processing industry is expected \nto rise by 3 to 5 percent.  The domestic market of agriculture will \nprobably stop shrinking.  A boost in demand is expected in external \nmarkets as well, which could mean agricultural exports of at least \n$2-2.2 billion.  According to preliminary figures, agricultural \nexports in 1993 exceeded $2 billion.  Compared with a record $2.7 \nbillion in 1992, this is a drop but is still more than the best \nresults in the socialist years.  Last year, agricultural exports \nwere down on the previous year by 8 to 9 percent.  Szabo denied that \nthere is a disastrous situation in agriculture.

In 1993, trading on the exchange exceeded \n13 billion forints ($130 million), two-and-one-half times the amount \nof the previous year.  Grain transactions amounted to a ninth of \ncommodity-exchange turnover last year, while trading on the two- \nyear-old meat division remained sluggish, with a turnover of less \nthan 200 million forints.  The newly founded foreign-currency \nexchange produced a turnover of 1.2 billion forints in its first \nnine months.  Although the first day of trading on the reopened \ncommodity exchange was October 25, 1989, trading began to gather \nmomentum only after price liberalization in 1990.  Grain turnover \nthat year reached 600 million forints.  Meat was introduced onto the \nBAT in 1991, but the 3 billion forint turnover that year was almost \nexclusively in grain.  Total trade in 1992 was close to 6 billion \nforints, with 1.5 million tons of grain changing hands there -- \nnearly a quarter of Hungary's overall grain trade. \n   1993 was successful for the BAT in several respects.  Although \nits turnover of 13.1 billion forints ($130 million) lagged far \nbehind that of the Budapest Stock Exchange (Budapesti Ertektozsde, \nBET), this was still Eastern Europe's highest commodities exchange \nturnover, matched only by the Prague commodity exchange.  The \nforeign-currency exchange, which opened last March, had a turnover \nof 1.2 billion forints in 1993.  Both this and the BET's currency \nexchange base their speculative market in U.S. dollars and German \nmarks on the safe background of Hungary's $20 billion export-import \ntraffic -- $3 billion of which is transacted by joint ventures. \n   In mid-October 1993, the Central Accounting House and Assets \nStore Co.  (CAHAS) was founded by the BET and the Hungarian National \nBank with equity capital of lOO million forints.  It operates as a \ncentral clearing house and joint backing to Hungary's commodity and \ncapital markets, conducting deals in futures, options, inter-bank \nsecurities, and foreign-currency exchange.  The house guarantees \nthat contracts are fulfilled on time, thus diminishing interest risk \nfor domestic investors and exchange-rate risk for foreign investors. \nTo tackle its increasing role, last year the BAT opened a new \nexchange room and started preparations for a new Central European \nenergy-trade division.  Its planned opening in the second half of \n1994 was supported by an international conference of the Central \nEuropean Energy Exchange Foundation, held in Budapest last November. \nAnnual oil trade in Eastern Europe is around 6O million tons, worth \n$12O billion.  Hungary's location at the intersection of two large \npipelines makes Budapest a good place to host an exchange for crude \noil from various countries, especially considering that the price of \noil from the former Soviet Union is not yet quoted on international \nexchanges.  However, Hungary must first adopt an exchange law before \nsetting up the Central European energy exchange.  The draft of the \nlaw was drawn up in 1992 and will probably go before the new \nparliament (to be elected this spring) sometime in the third quarter \nof 1994.

By the end of 1993, the aircraft had \ncaused losses of $2 million.  The flights were well booked, but only \nbecause of low ticket prices forced on MALEV by strong competition. \nRevenue also suffered because the aircraft made stops in Rome. \nMALEV lost 1 billion forints in 1993, with big exchange rate costs \non loans coming from devaluations of the Hungarian forint. \n(Budapest MTI in English 1722 GMT 24 Jan 94 AU) \n   NEW POWER STATION FOR BUDAPEST WORLD EXPO:  A new 180-megawatt \nblock is to be completed at the Budapest Power Station of Kelenfold. \nTo be constructed by the joint Hungarian-Italian company Ganz \nAnsaldo -- from World Bank and European Investment Bank credit -- \nthe new block will not only produce electricity but will heat 50,000 \nflats with what is called \"tired steam.\"  The 260 million forint \ninvestment will be completed in the second half of 1995.

As the funds are regulated by law, only \nParliament has the authority to change them.  Under the law on \npublic finances, as of last year, only separate state funds that \nhave been set up by legislation are eligible for central budget \nsupport.  Seven funds were established under one law:  funds for \ntourism, trade development, investment promotion, water management, \nenvironmental protection, market intervention, and regional \ndevelopment.  A further six agricultural funds were set up under one \nlaw and other funds are regulated by individual laws.  The draft \nbill proposes that all funds connected with economic development be \nmerged.  This would involve the creation of a single fund, managed \nby the Finance Ministry, to replace the existing separate funds for \nemployment, regional development, investment promotion, trade \ndevelopment, and technical development. \n   I 1993, just over a third of the funds' total income came from \ncentral budget support, and this year the proportion will fall to \nslightly over a sixth, even though the total income of the funds \nwill be 20 billion forints higher this year than last.  Other \nsources of income for the funds this year include 26 billion forints \nfrom tax revenue allocated directly to the funds, of which 15 \nbillion forints will go to the Road Fund.

In signaling its willingness to move toward holding \nan inter-Korean summit, the North also claimed that it is the \nSouth that has repeatedly rejected North Korean summit offers, \nincluding one heretofore unreported.  In keeping with its new \ninterest in exchanging envoys, Pyongyang media have so far \ncontinued to temper personal attacks on ROK President Kim Yong- \nsam, a circumspection first noted last week. \n\n                                  END SUMMARY \n\n   Pyongyang media treatment of the 12 March working-level talks \nsuggested that the North is poised to strike a deal with the \nSouth on the exchange of special envoys.  Pyongyang radio on 12 \nMarch depicted the North Korean chief delegate--identified in \nSouth Korean media as Pak Yong-su--as noting that of the 28 \npoints raised in connection with procedural matters for the envoy \nexchange, \"all but four points\" had been agreed upon \"in \nprinciple.\"  Furthermore, Pak was cited as making conciliatory \ngestures for resolving the four North Korean demands: \n\n+ Pak said that two issues--the \"large-scale nuclear war \nexercises\" and the \"international cooperation system\" (an \nallusion to threats of UN sanctions)--could be discussed by the \nenvoys.  Further defusing these issues, he claimed that the South \nhad announced its decision \"not to stage\" Team Spirit this year. \n\n+ On the introduction of the Patriot missile to the South, he \nseemed to agree with the South's alleged statement that \"the \nsituation had changed\" because Seoul \"had already decided to \nshelve the plan\" to bring in the missiles. \n\n+ On ROK President Kim's earlier remarks that he \"cannot shake \nhands with a party that possesses nuclear weapons,\" Pak seemed to \nsuggest that the question is moot, since the \"person in the \nhighest authority\" in the South subsequently said that the North \nhas no nuclear weapons. \n\n   Pak noted that although the South's response to the four North \nKorean demands still falls \"short of our expectations,\" it is \nproof of Seoul's recognition of the basic \"reasonableness\" of the \ndemands (Pyongyang radio, 12 March)--a formulation that may allow \nPyongyang, having made its points, to yield without losing its \n\"dignity.\" \n\n   Summit Talks     Signaling a willingness to eventually hold a \nNorth-South summit meeting, while at the same time illustrating \nNorth Korea's desire to put the South on the defensive, Pak \nclaimed that the South has rejected the North's offers of top- \nlevel talks dating back 20 years.  In particular, he revealed \nthat in \"early April 1992\" an unnamed North Korean \"special \nenvoy  visited Seoul and invited the ROK president to Pyongyang \naround the time of DPRK President Kim Il-song's 80th birthday. \nImplying that Pyongyang could use the South's rejection of the \nsummit for propaganda purposes, Pak pointedly noted that up to \nnow the North had \"never mentioned\" its special envoy's visit to \nSeoul or his offer. \n\n   Joint Communique     Seeking to foster the impression of progress \nat the 12 March meeting, the North unsuccessfully proposed a \nNorth-South joint communique(SEE NOTE) to \"reconfirm\" both sides' \nintention to exchange envoys \"at an early date.\"  Pyongyang \napparently hoped it could use such a communique to claim to \nWashington that North Korea has met its prerequisites for \nreconvening high-level U.S.-North Korea talks.  (Although U.S.- \nDPRK high-level talks tentatively are set to start on 21 March, \nWashington is reportedly insisting that the special envoys must \nbe exchanged between the North and South before such talks could \nbe held (Yonhap, 12 March).) \n\n(NOTE: Precedents for issuing North-South joint communiques in \nrecent years are somewhat mixed.  A joint communique was issued \nat the fourth round of inter-Korean prime ministerial talks \n(Pyongyang radio, 24 October) in a departure from the practice of \nthe previous three rounds.  Communiques were also issued \nfollowing inter-Korean talks on the nuclear issue in 1992 \n(Pyongyang radio, 19 February 1992, 14 March 1992).  However, in \nAugust 1992 the South rejected a North Korean proposal for a \njoint communique following another meeting on the nuclear issue \n(Yonhap, 31 August 1992).) \n\n   Just how eagerly Pyongyang wanted a joint communique was \ndemonstrated in the extraordinarily conciliatory remarks Pak made \nin pressing for the communique.  In accusing the South of \ndelaying the realization of the envoy exchange by \"suspecting\" \nKorean motives, Pyongyang radio portrayed Pak as indirectly \nadmitting that the North was also partly to blame for the delay \n(12 March).  The radio cited him as saying that the North on its \npart had created \"four barriers \"--a clear reference to the four \nNorth Korean demands.  In pleading for compromise, Pak also \ncautioned against the sides playing a zero-sum game, declaring \nthat neither side should \"absolutize\" its own position. \n\n   Limiting Rhetoric     In line with the image of conciliation the \nNorth Korean leadership is trying to project, Pyongyang media \nhave in recent days continued to moderate their personal attacks \non ROK President Kim.  The KCNA report of an 11 March commentary \nin the party paper Nodong Sinmun calling for unity of South \nKorean \"patriots\" against their government avoided using the \nSouth Korean leader's name, referring to the ROK Government only \nas the \"'civilian' fascist forces\" (11 March).  For the past few \nmonths, Pyongyang media have been signaling the North's \nreluctance to deal with the South Korean government with repeated \nharsh personal attacks on President Kim.  The first sign of \nmoderation on this issue appeared last week. \n\n   Implications     Pyongyang's attempt to project a conciliatory \nstance toward Seoul suggests that the North may try to work out a \nsubstantive accord on the envoy exchange at the next scheduled \nsession on 16 March.  Failing that, the North may hope that \ntaking the high road on this issue will strengthen its contention \nof the South's intransigence and thus enable it to pressure the \nUnited States to proceed with bilateral talks. \n\n(AUTHOR:  YIM.

Reinforcing \nearlier warnings against the imposition of preconditions for the \ntalks, the spokesman threatened that North Korea would call off \nthe meeting and refuse future nuclear inspections.  Pyongyang \nradio at the same time issued an oblique threat to proceed with a \nnuclear arms development program. \n\n                                END SUMMARY \n\n   Seeking to place Washington on the defensive, the Foreign \nMinistry spokesman's statement, carried by Pyongyang radio on 15 \nMarch, declared that North Korea has \"completely fulfilled\" its \nobligations under the 25 February DPRK-U.S. agreement and called \non the United States to do its part without setting \"unreasonable \npreconditions.\"  Repeating the familiar refrain on the 25 \nFebruary accord, the spokesman said that the accord set forth \n\"simultaneous\" action by both sides, namely 1)\"resumption\" of \ninter-Korean contacts for exchanging special envoys and 2)IAEA \ninspections for ensuring continuity of safeguards on Pyongyang's \npart, in return for 1)suspension of Team Spirit and 2)resumption \nof DPRK-U.S. high-level talks in Geneva on 21 March.  Now that \n\"several rounds\" of inter-Korean talks have been held and IAEA \ninspections \"enough for continuity of safeguards\" have been \ncompleted, he warned, any U.S. failure to fulfill its obligations \nwill \"automatically\" render the 25 February accord \"invalid.\"  If \nWashington persists in its \"unreasonable\" insistence that nuclear \ninspections must be proven \"satisfactory\" to the IAEA and that \nspecial envoys must be exchanged by the North and the South \nbefore Team Spirit can be cancelled or the bilateral talks can \ntake place, the spokesman warned, Pyongyang will consider DPRK- \nU.S. negotiations to have ended in a \"rupture\" and will take \nunspecified \"unilateral\" and \"appropriate\" action. \n\n   Ominous Threat     Clearly seeking to add weight to its threats, \nPyongyang seems to be preparing a public fallback position in \ncase of failure of its nuclear talks with Washington by hinting \nat a readiness to proceed with a nuclear weapons program.  In the \nlatest variant of this threat, Pyongyang radio on 15 March \nreiterated North Korea's profession of concern for alleged \nJapanese plans to develop a nuclear capability.  After \ncriticizing Japanese Foreign Minister Hata's alleged statement on \n\"countermeasures\" in case of North Korean intransigence on the \nnuclear issue, the radio declared that Pyongyang \"may face a \nsituation of having no choice but to reconsider [its] position \nregarding the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\" \n\n   IAEA Inspections     The 15 March statement comes amid reporting \nof the departure of a group of IAEA inspectors from Pyongyang \n(KCNA, 15 March) and speculation that the IAEA may hold a special \nBoard of Governors meetings to address difficulties encountered \nby the inspectors (Yonhap, 15 March).  Giving credence to foreign \nmedia accounts of disputes between Pyongyang and IAEA inspectors, \nSeoul's KBS-1 radio carried a report of a North Korean Embassy \nofficial in Beijing saying that Pyongyang had rejected a request \nby IAEA inspectors to extract samples from \"one facility,\" \nregarding it as an \"unjust demand\" (15 March).  The councillor, \nChoe Han-chun, was depicted as playing down the significance of \nthe dispute, claiming that it was \"not a serious problem\" and can \nbe resolved through future dialogue between North Korean and the \nIAEA. \n\n   Implications     Pyongyang is clearly moving to forestall any \nIAEA move to convene a special meeting of the Board of Governors- \n-a predecessor to possible referral of the North Korean nuclear \nissue to the UN Security Council.  By assuming a tough position \nand emphasizing the gravity of the situation, the North Korean \nleadership seems to hope that Washington will propose a \ncompromise solution. \n(AUTHOR:  YIM.

        "text": "\n\nS                            U M M A R Y \n      Although the vote by the State Duma to amnesty prisoners \nimplicated in the August 1991 coup and the October 1993 Supreme \nSoviet uprising marks the Duma's most confrontational move \nagainst President Boris Yeltsin to date, it was passed as part of \na compromise package that somewhat mitigated its anti- \npresidential thrust.  Centrists and moderate reformers supported \nthe amnesty after hardliners gave up a legislative commission \nthat was to have investigated last autumn's constitutional crisis \nand agreed to accept an additional document defining the amnesty \nas part of a movement toward national reconciliation.  The \namnesty vote appears to have weakened Yeltsin politically and has \ndeepened the divisions among reformers, further undermining their \nability to fight the anti-Yeltsin opposition in the legislature. \n                           END SUMMARY \n   Hardliners in the Duma scored a political victory over Yeltsin \nwhen, with the help of centrists and moderate reformers, the Duma \nadopted on 23 February a package of decrees amnestying prisoners \ncharged in the 1991 coup attempt and the 1993 uprising, including \nYeltsin's archenemies Ruslan Khasbulatov and Aleksandr Rutskoy. \nThe Duma had debated but failed to approve a political amnesty \nseveral times previously, but proponents scored a breakthrough on \n22 February when the Duma's Council put together a \"large\" \ncompromise package that included decrees on a criminal and \npolitical amnesty, a memorandum calling for national accord, and \na decree that apparently abolishes a Duma commission established \non 9 February to investigate the events of 21 September to 4 \nOctober (see box 1) (Radio Rossii, 9 February; Segodnya, 23 \nFebruary).  Legislative hardliners had intended to use the \ncommission to attack Yeltsin by publicly questioning the \nconstitutionality of his edict dissolving the Supreme Soviet. \nDuring the Council's session, hardliners reportedly agreed to \n\"act as if the vote on setting up the commission never took \nplace,\" a choice that reportedly caused considerable anguish \namong more extreme Yeltsin opponents, who did not want to give up \nthe commission (Segodnya, 23 February; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 \nFebruary). \n   How the Factions Voted \n   The compromise amnesty package passed 252 to 67 (with 28 \nabstentions)--just 29 votes above the required majority--with the \nbulk of support coming from hard-line deputies.  According to an \naccount by a Communist Party (CPRF) deputy published in \nSovetskaya Rossiya (26 February), the CPRF, Agrarian Party, \nLiberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and the hard-line \nnationalist \"Russian Way\" group led by Sergey Baburin provided \n147 votes for the compromise amnesty package.  Some hardliners, \nhowever, including nine CPRF deputies and one each from the \nAgrarian Party and Russian Way, were so intent on retaining the \nDuma's investigative commission into the September-October crisis \nthat they voted against the final compromise. \n   After a decree abolishing the investigative commission was added \nto the \"large\" package, enough centrists and moderate reformers \njoined in supporting the amnesty compromise to put it over the \ntop.  Apparently at the urging of Party of Russian Unity and \nAccord (PRES) leader Sergey Shakhray, PRES and the Women of \nRussia faction, joined by at least some members of the centrist \nNew Regional Policy group, made their support for the amnesty \npackage contingent on the inclusion of a \"Memorandum of Accord,\" \nessentially a political declaration calling for round table talks \non economic and political issues and recommending amnesty as a \nstep toward \"national reconciliation\" (Interfax, 23 February). \nEven with the inclusion of the Memorandum of Accord, however, \nthis \"small\" amnesty package did not have enough support to pass. \nOnly two PRES deputies voted for the \"small\" package.  When the \ndecree abolishing the commission was added to the \"large\" \ncompromise package, it gained the votes of 16 more PRES deputies \n(of 24 present to vote).  Similarly, 35 deputies from the New \nRegional Policy group voted for the \"small\" package, but an \nadditional 12 members voted for the final compromise that \nabolished the commission.  Other centrist deputies voting for the \nfinal compromise included all 22 members from Women of Russia and \nall 14 deputies from the Nikolay Travkin's Democratic Party of \nRussia faction who were present to vote (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26 \nFebruary). \n   The compromise package appears to have deepened divisions among \nreformers, pitting the pro-Yeltsin Russia's Choice faction \nagainst PRES and splitting the moderate reformist Yabloko bloc \nled by reform economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy.  Russia's Choice \nheld together in its opposition to the political amnesty, with \nonly one of its members--Ivan Starikov of Novosibirsk--willing to \nvote for the final compromise (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 2 March). \nHowever, only 57 of its 75 members were present to vote.  Most of \nthe Yavlinskiy bloc--16 of the 22 who were present at the vote- \n-either abstained or voted against both amnesty packages, but the \nother six took a strong anti-Yeltsin stand, voting only for the \n\"small\" package and against the final compromise (Sovetskaya \nRossiya, 26 February).  Their position appears related to the \nstance voiced by some members of the bloc following the October \nrebellion. (See Note 1) \n   (Note 1)  During the election campaign, Vladimir Lukin, a \ncoleader of the Yabloko bloc, advocated a full investigation into \nthe events of 21 September-4 October, though lie acknowledged that \nextremists in the Supreme Soviet had \"started this carnage\" and \nhad \"brought about dozens of human casualties\" (Literaturnaya \nGazeta, No. 47, 24 November 1993).  Shortly after the election \nanother bloc member, Valeriy Borshchev (of the Christian \nDemocratic Union), expressed the bloc's intention to promote the \nestablishment of a parliamentary commission to conduct the \ninvestigation (Segodnya, 23 December 1993).  Lukin's support for \nthe commission evidently caused him, as well as other Yabloko \ndeputies Viktor Sheynis and Nikolay Petrakov, to abstain from the \nvote for the final compromise package (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 2 \nMarch). \n   Background to the Amnesty Issue \n   Since convening, the Duma has debated two kinds of amnesty \nproposals, one a criminal amnesty aimed at minor offenders and \nthe other a political amnesty for the 1991 coup plotters and \nparticipants in the 1993 Supreme Soviet uprising.  During the \nfirst week of the Duma's session, hard-line deputies made their \nfirst move toward securing a political amnesty for their \npolitical allies, but their failure to coordinate with the LDPR, \nwhich was pressing its own political amnesty proposal, caused the \nmove to fail (ITAR-TASS, 17 January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 \nJanuary).  Yeltsin revived the amnesty issue when he submitted a \nproposal for a criminal amnesty \"in connection with the adoption \nof\" the constitution (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January), continuing \na Soviet-era tradition of declaring amnesties to mark major \nholidays and significant political milestones.  In retrospect, \nthis move was doubly unfortunate for Yeltsin.  His proposal \nfailed to attract support from reformers and gave hardliners \nanother opportunity to raise the issue of a political amnesty. \n   -- On 17 January, Vasiliy Lipitskiy, a close associate of \nRutskoy, proposed putting the political amnesty issue on the \nDuma's agenda, but the motion fell 18 votes short of a majority, \nreportedly because the LDPR did not back him (ITAR-TASS, 17 \nJanuary; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 January; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 27 \nJanuary).  At the time, the LDPR was advocating an amnesty that \nwould have freed anyone sentenced on \"political or economic \ncharges\" after April 1985 and also would have released from jail \nRutskoy, Khasbulatov, and other participants in the October \nuprising but placed them under house arrest (Interfax, 31 \nDecember 1993; ITAR-TASS, 4 January). \n   -- Yeltsin's proposal, submitted shortly after he signed it on 21 \nJanuary, quickly ran into trouble.  The CPRF and Agrarian Party \nwere unwilling to consider it because it did not amnesty their \npolitical allies, and the LDPR stood by its version.  Even \nRussia's Choice--the faction most likely to support the \npresident--was unwilling to back the bill, apparently in an \neffort to erase public perceptions that it is soft on crime. \nFaction leader Yegor Gaydar stated that Russia's Choice could not \nsupport Yeltsin's initiative because \"we are very doubtful about \nthe provisions . . . which reduce punishments for serious \ncriminal offenses\" and pointedly drew attention to the \"existing \ncriminal situation in the country\" (ITAR-TASS, 21 January, 7 \nFebruary).  In a further indication of trouble for Yeltsin, his \nproposal was assigned to the Committee for Legislation, Judicial, \nand Legal Reform, headed by Vladimir Isakov--a staunch Yeltsin \nfoe from the Agrarian Party (ITAR-TASS, 24 January). \n   -- The amnesty issue was scheduled to come up for debate in the \nDuma's 4 February plenary session, but the Duma's Council \npostponed the debate, probably in recognition that none of the \ncompeting proposals would win a majority (Interfax, Segodnya, 3 \nFebruary).  According to the Duma's First Deputy Chairman Mikhail \nMityukov (Russia's Choice), the Council postponed debate because \n\"certain factions\" wanted to \"play the amnesty card for political \npurposes\" (Izvestiya, 5  February).  By that time, Isakov's \ncommittee had drafted its own decree to amnesty the participants \nin the 1991 coup attempt and the October uprising (Segodnya, 4 \nFebruary). \n   -- By mid-February, elements of the final compromise began to \nemerge as the Duma agreed to examine both Yeltsin's criminal \namnesty proposal and an apparently revised LDPR political amnesty \nproposal.  The Duma took no direct action on Yeltsin's criminal \namnesty proposal during its 16 February debate, possibly because \nthe debate made it clear that it lacked majority support \n(Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Kommersant-Daily, 17 February).  The Duma \nthen decided to consider separately two draft decrees--Yeltsin's \non a criminal amnesty and an LDPR proposal on an economic and \npolitical amnesty (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 16 February).  More \nominously for Yeltsin, the PRES and Women of Russia factions \noffered conditional backing for the political amnesty, reportedly \ninsisting on \"circulating\" a \"clarification document\" --evidently \na reference to the Memorandum of Accord that the Duma later \nadopted in the final compromise package--making it clear that the \nfactions supported the amnesty as a step toward \"national \nreconciliation\" and not simply for the sake of freeing Rutskoy \nand Khasbulatov (Segodnya, 16 February).  On 17 February the \nLDPR's political amnesty proposal fell 23 votes short of adoption \nand was sent back to committee for \"improvement,\" this time going \nto the security committee, headed by Yeltsin foe Viktor Ilyukhin \n(CPRF), as well as to Isakov's legislation committee (Interfax, \nITAR-TASS, 17 February). \n   Disarray in the Yeltsin Camp \n   The varied responses from Yeltsin's advisers to the Duma's \npassage of the amnesty suggest that the event caught them \nunprepared, even though the approval of the compromise package by \nthe Duma's Council on 22 February should have given them some \nwarning of its improved prospects. (See Note 2)  National \nSecurity Adviser Yuriy Baturin opted for a confrontational \nstance, arguing that the amnesty was unconstitutional because it \nwas in fact a pardon, which is a presidential prerogative (ITAR- \nTASS, 24 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 February).  By \ncontrast, Aleksandr M. Yakovlev, Yeltsin's official \nrepresentative to the legislature, responded in sanguine fashion, \ncontending that the amnesty was \"completely in keeping with the \nconstitution from a judicial point of view\" (Russian TV, 24 \nFebruary).  Georgiy Satarov, a Yeltsin adviser on legislative \nrelations, did not weigh in until two days after the vote, when \nhe indicated that Yeltsin was preparing a \"calm and businesslike \nletter\" asking the Duma to reconsider its stance (Interfax, \nMoscow radio, Ostankino TV, 25 February). \n   (Note 2)  Much of the disarray in the Yeltsin camp may be \nattributed to the absence of presidential Administration Leader \nSergey Filatov, who was apparently in Switzerland at the time \n(ITAR-TASS, 27 February).  Yakovlev, Satarov, and Baturin are all \nrelatively new to the Yeltsin team, and their inexperience may \nhave contributed to their uncoordinated response (For more on \nYeltsin's advisers, see the Trends of 9 March 1994, pages 4-12). \n   Yeltsin himself responded too late to postpone or block \nimplementation of the political amnesty.  On 26 February he sent \na letter to Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, drawing upon Baturin's \nline of argument and reportedly asserting that the deputies had \nconfused the constitutional principles of amnesty and pardon. \nThe letter urged the Duma to \"improve\" the decree to bring it in \nline with the constitution.  Yeltsin also proposed that the Duma \nadopt a \"system of criteria\" defining the responsibility of state \ninstitutions and politicians \"for decisions [that] hamper our \njoint policy towards national reconciliation, civil peace, and \naccord\"--evidently an attempt to impress upon the Duma its \naccountability for the actions of individuals released under the \namnesty (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  Satarov reportedly delivered \nYeltsin's letter to Rybkin on the afternoon of 26 February, when \nRutskoy, Khasbulatov, and other prisoners arrested after the \nOctober uprising were already walking out of Lefortovo prison \n(see box 2) (ITAR-TASS, 26 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, \nIzvestiya, 1 March). \n   After the futile letter to Rybkin, Yeltsin appeared to waver \nbetween taking a confrontational approach and trying to defuse \npolitical tensions.  At first he was confrontational, with \nS,,atarov announcing on 28 February that Yeltsin was preparing \ncertain actions aimed at defending the democratic state and \nsociety\" (Russian TV, 28 February).  Satarov's comments and \nothers by Baturin and presidential press secretary Vyacheslav \nKostikov fueled speculation that Yeltsin would address the \ncountry that night in a special televised appeal (ITAR-TASS, 28 \nFebruary).  Nezavisimaya Gazeta's Ivan Rodin reported (2 March) \nthat Yeltsin was to have announced on television an edict that, \nwhile not containing \"any specific tough measures,\" nonetheless \nbrandished a \"menacing\" tone.  Rodin also suggested, however, \nthat threatening a tough presidential response may have been a \ndeliberate tactic to bring pressure on Rybkin before a meeting \nheld the same day between Yeltsin's advisers--including the newly \nreturned Head of Administration Sergey Filatov--and Rybkin. \nRybkin and Filatov reportedly discussed ways to improve \n\"interaction\" between the two branches, paving the way for \nYeltsin to meet with Rybkin the following day (ITAR-TASS, 28 \nFebruary). \n   After his meeting with Rybkin, Yeltsin appears to have adopted a \nposition of accepting the amnesty and placing the burden of \nresponsibility for it--and for the actions of the released \nprisoners--squarely on the Duma.  At their 1 March meeting, \nRybkin reportedly promised Yeltsin that the Duma would \"ensure a \nmore balanced approach\" when adopting decrees likely to have \n\"serious political and moral consequences\" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). \nYeltsin apparently also extracted a pledge from Rybkin that he \nwould urge the Duma \"probably in the near future\" to adopt a \nmemorandum on the \"responsibility of state institutions and \npoliticians for preserving civic calm in Russia\" (Moscow radio, 1 \nMarch).  In return, Yeltsin assured Rybkin that he had opted \nagainst \"immediate tough measures,\" but he warned that he would \nnot tolerate misbehavior by his amnestied foes, saying: \"Should \nthe slightest attempt be made at destabilizing the situation in \nthe country, [the amnestied prisoners] will be arrested straight \nafter\" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). \n   As a result of the initial confused reaction by his advisers and \nthe conflicting signals about his course of action, Yeltsin \nappears to have lost political stature in the aftermath of the \namnesty vote.  His acceptance of the amnesty conflicts with his \nrepeated assertions--most recently stated at the 4 March \nGovernment meeting--that the Duma's amnesty is unconstitutional \n(Moscow radio, 4 March).  In an effort to counter press accounts \nof executive disarray (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Izvestiya, 1 March) as \nwell as criticism of his handling of the amnesty by Russia's \nChoice members (Izvestiya, 3 March), Yeltsin apparently saw the \nneed to verbally assert his presidential authority after meeting \nwith Rybkin: \"I . . . am in full control of the social and \npolitical situation\" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March). \n   Implications \n   The Duma's successful passage of a political amnesty suggests \nthat Yeltsin and his team of advisers have learned little since \nthe confrontation with the old Supreme Soviet about how to manage \nrelations with the legislative branch, much less to effectively \nadvance a presidential agenda.  By contrast, the Duma has again \ndemonstrated its ability to compromise effectively on issues it \nconsiders important, with the Duma Council apparently playing a \nkey role.  By postponing debate when it recognized that the Duma \nlacked consensus on the issue and brokering the final key \ncompromise, the Duma's leadership demonstrated a knack for \nmanaging the legislative process.  Rybkin personally appears to \nhave emerged from the amnesty vote with enhanced political \nstature.  His meetings with Filatov and Yeltsin and pledges to \nimprove legislative-executive coordination suggest the makings of \nan effective political player, at least for as long as his \nCommunist-Agrarian colleagues are willing to back such \nconciliatory politics and allow Rybkin to deliver on his pledges. \n   Box 1 \n                 The \"Large\" Compromise Package \n   Resorting to the kind of package compromise that has worked for \nthe Duma in the past,* deputies voted on a total of five \ndocuments, all of which came into effect after their publication \nin Rossiyskaya Gazeta on 26 February.  The decree overturning the \nDuma's investigative commission into the October crisis was not \nincluded in an earlier \"small\" package that failed to pass: \n   -- \"On Declaring an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of \nthe Russian Federation Constitution.\"  This decree, based largely \non the draft amnesty bill that Yeltsin submitted to parliament \n(Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January), amnesties criminals convicted \nof minor offenses as well as certain groups of offenders, such as \nwomen and invalids.  According to Minister of Internal Affairs \nViktor Yerin, the criminal amnesty affects \"less than 10 percent\" \nof convicted criminals, and another MVD general put the number at \nabout 20,000 (Argumenty i Fakty No. 6, February; Pravda, 26 \nFebruary). \n   -- Decree outlining the procedures for implementing the above \ndecree. \n   -- \"On Declaring a Political and Economic Amnesty.\"  This \ndocument--the one opposed most bitterly by Yeltsin supporters- \n-specifically terminates legal proceedings against the 1991 coup \nplotters and hardliners arrested after the violent 1 May \ndemonstrations in Moscow and the October 1993 Supreme Soviet \nuprising and stipulates that their release from prison take place \n\"immediately.\"  In an apparent effort to gain the support of some \nreformers and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), it \nalso amnesties criminals sentenced for various Soviet-era \neconomic crimes. \n   -- \"On the Adoption of the Memorandum of Accord.\"  This decree \nformally approves the \"Memorandum of Accord\" put forward by PRES, \nthe Women of Russia, and the New Regional Policy factions calling \nupon the legislative and executive branches to consider \"jointly\" \nproblems presented by \"political, economic, and social reforms in \nsociety\" and urging authorities to wage their \"political struggle \nwithin a legal framework.\"  The memorandum also suggested that a \npolitical amnesty could serve as an \"integral part\" of the \nprocess toward \"national accord.\"  Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has \nrepeatedly called this memorandum the most important document of \nthe package (Pravda, 1 March; Komsomolskaya Pravda, 2 March). \n      \"On Overturning a Decree of the State Duma.\"  This decree \nreportedly over turns the 9 February decision of the Duma to set \nup a commission to investigate the events of 21 September-4 \nOctober, although its wording is somewhat ambiguous.  It annuls a \n16 February decree on the \"composition\" of the commission, \nleaving open the possibility that the commission has not formally \nbeen disbanded. \n   *See the Trends of 9 February 1994, pages 15-25. \n   End Box 1 \n   Box 2 \n            Prosecutor Protests Yeltsin Pressure on Amnesty \n   Judging by comments made after the prisoners' release, both the \nYeltsin team and Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin were counting on \nProsecutor General Aleksey Kazannik to block or delay \nimplementation of the amnesty.  Kazannik's office reportedly made \nan \"inquiry\" to the Duma about certain provisions in the amnesty, \nand Rybkin indicated in his meeting with Satarov on 26 February \nthat the Duma's legislation and security committees were \nresponding to the inquiry and that no prisoners would be released \nuntil the questions were cleared up (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  At \na meeting of parliamentary officials on 28 February, Rybkin \ncharged that the prosecutor's office acted on the amnesty with \nundue haste\" and without waiting for a response to its questions \n(Interfax, Radio Rossii, 28 February).  He later appeared to \nchange his story somewhat--possibly in an attempt to deflect \nblame from the security and legislation committees--when he \ncontended that the committees had \"clarified every point\" of \nKazannik's inquiry by 26 February (Pravda, 1 March). \n   Yeltsin reportedly tried to pressure Kazannik to delay \nimplementing the amnesty, but Kazannik, while declaring his \ndistaste for the amnesty, said that he had no legal authority to \nblock it and resigned rather than submit to Yeltsin's pressure. \nKazannik had implicitly warned Yeltsin that he would not bow to \npolitical pressures over the amnesty issue when he stated that \nhis office does not give \"political assessments\" to various laws \nbut only ensures their \"lawfulness and strict fulfillment\" (ITAR- \nTASS, 24 February).  In his resignation statement, Kazannik \ncharged that Yeltsin had appealed to him to \"suspend\" the amnesty \nprocess, and though he indicated that he personally agreed with \nthe \"civic attitude\" of Yeltsin's appeal, he made clear his \nprofessional and political independence: \"The prosecutor in \nRussia does not have the authority to suspend an amnesty act \n[or] to appeal to the State Duma for a resolution to be \nreconsidered\" (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  Despite his refusal to \ndelay implementing the amnesty, Kazannik appears to harbor no \nsympathy for the amnestied prisoners, asserting in his \nresignation statement that he considered the Duma's vote for \npolitical amnesty a \"black page in the history of Russian \nparliamentarianism\" (ITAR-TASS, 26 February). \n   * Kazannik has now changed his mind about resigning and has \nindicated that he will ask the Federation Council, which has the \nconstitutional authority to confirm the appointment and dismissal \nof the prosecutor general, not to accept his 26 February \nresignation (Russian TV, Izvestiya, 12 March).  Yeltsin, however, \nappears intent on securing Kazannik's resignation.  On 14 March \nhe issued a decree affirming his acceptance of Kazannik's \nresignation and arguing that because Kazannik was appointed by \npresidential decree before the new constitution was adopted, his \nrelease from office does not require the Federation Council's \napproval (ITAR-TASS, 14 March). \n   End Box 2 \n   (AUTHOR:  O'CONNELL.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n                                           While seeking to wrest as many concessions as possible from \nIsrael and the United States in the aftermath of the Hebron \nmassacre, PLO leaders also appear to be maintaining a degree of \nflexibility in their position on terms for resuming peace \nnegotiations with Israel.  In addition, PLO statements aimed at \nPalestinian audiences appear to be preparing popular opinion for \na compromise. \n                                     END SUMMARY \n   Following meetings in Tunis between Palestinian leaders and \ndelegations from Israel and the United States, PLO Executive \nCommittee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh reiterated PLO demands that \nIsrael must take action against Jewish settlers in the occupied \nterritories before the PLO will agree to resume negotiations. \nMeetings with U.S. officials, he told an interviewer, \"have not \nachieved progress,\" and he complained that Washington is seeking \nto link issuance of a Security Council resolution on the Hebron \nmassacre to PLO acceptance of a date for resumption of \nnegotiations.  A Security Council resolution, 'Abd-Rabbuh argued, \nwould be effective only \"if it ensures practical steps . . . to \nguarantee international protection for the Palestinian people\" \nand should not be \"a bargaining card to resume talks.\"  More \nspecifically, he called for \"ending the settlers' presence in the \nheart of Hebron\" and other areas constituting \"hotbeds of tension \nand explosion,\" \"tackling the issue of the presence of armed \nsettlers . . . in Palestinian towns and villages,\" and \"providing \ninternational protection, especially in Hebron\" (Radio Monte \nCarlo, 15 March). \n   Other recent statements by mainstream PLO leaders and media have \nalso stressed that Israel must act against settlers and that \nsecurity for Palestinians in the territories must be ensured, but \nthe statements appear to have been carefully crafted to avoid \ntaking any uncompromising positions that might threaten \nresumption of negotiations.  For example: \n   --PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat branded Jewish settlements in Hebron \nas \"illegal\" in an interview with a French newspaper but said \nthat he is \"not asking for them to be destroyed, but moved.\"  He \nalso repeated his call for an \"international presence\" in the \nterritories to ensure Palestinian security, but appeared careful \nto couch the demand in terms designed not to offend Israel.  Such \nan international presence, he said, would be consistent with the \nprovisions of the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP)--a \ncondition laid down by Israeli leaders.  In addition, 'Arafat \nsuggested an armed international force only when questioned \nexplicitly on the subject, asking rhetorically \"who will protect \nthis international force?  The armed Jewish settlers?\" and \nanswering that the observers must \"protect themselves.\" \nSimilarly cautious on U.S. policy, 'Arafat complained that the \nUnited States is blocking inclusion of any reference to Jerusalem \nin the UN Security Council resolution currently under discussion \nbut was circumspect overall in commenting on U.S. policy.  \"We \nmust . . . wait until the whole U.S. reaction is revealed at all \nlevels and not just in the Security Council,\" he said, and he \nasked rhetorically whether the United States will \"be up to the \nresponsibilities which it has shouldered since the signing of \nthis DOP.\"  He also demanded that Israel complete withdrawal from \nthe Gaza Strip and Jericho by 12 April in keeping with the DOP, \nbut when asked what he would do if the deadline was not met, he \nanswered only \"that would mean that the Israeli Government had \ndecided not to respect our agreements\" (Paris Le Figaro, Il \nMarch). \n   --Commenting on Israel's decision to ban extremist settler \norganizations, PLO official Ahmad Quray', a key figure in \nnegotiating the DOP, described the Israeli action as \"a good step \nin the right direction\" but \"not enough.\"  There must be, he \nadded, \"a more substantial solution\" specifying that \"measures \nmust be taken around the Ibrahimi Mosque [sight of the Hebron \nmassacre] and the locations of settlers\" (Ool Yisra'el, 13 \nMarch). \n   --A PLO radio commentary excoriated the United States for \nallegedly blocking a Security Council resolution on the Hebron \nmassacre, but avoided any explicit threats or demands.  The \nUnited States, the radio charged, is \"resisting this desire for \njustice by the international community\" and displaying its \n\"support for, bias toward, and collusion with Israel; that is, in \nfavor of terrorism, crime, and massacre.\"  Washington's \"strange \nand abnormal logic,\" the commentary added, \"runs counter to \njustice and history\" and \"destroys the foundations of the peace \nprocess,\" to the detriment not only of Palestinians but of \"all \nparties, including Israel and the protector of its terrorism, the \nUnited States\" (Voice of Palestine [VOP] in Yemen, 13 March). \n   Preparing Palestinian Opinion for a Deal \n   Two recent commentaries in PLO media addressed to Palestinian \naudiences strongly suggest that the PLO leadership, mindful of \npopular Palestinian anger following the Hebron massacre, is \nattempting gradually to prepare Palestinian opinion to accept an \neventual compromise formula on resuming formal peace negotiations \nwith Israel. \n   --A VOP commentary said that 'Arafat \"is under strong pressure to \nleave the peace talks\" but argued that the peace process must \ncontinue.  Palestinians, the commentary said, are seeking \"a more \neffective U.S. role\" following the massacre, but it warned that \n\"there are limits to what the Clinton administration can do in \nits dealing with the Yitzhaq Rabin government\" and that \"the PLO \nshould be satisfied with achieving limited gains.\"  \"What will \neventually be required,\" VOP argued, \"is to effect a balance \nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators.\"  Although \nPalestinian gains may initially be limited, the commentary \nconcluded, \"unquestionably the decision to go ahead with the \nnegotiations will achieve more significant gains in the future\"- \n-a conclusion it justified by noting that \"for the first time, \nthe . . . issue of settlements . . . is being raised inside the \nIsraeli Government itself\" (10 March). \n   --An article appearing in the PLO's weekly news magazine \nacknowledged that the PLO's demand for a Security Council \nresolution \"condemning the massacre, calling for an international \npresence in the occupied territories . . . and indicating that \nJerusalem is part of the occupied territories as a condition for \nresuming bilateral talks with Israel\" could result in \"some sort \nof confrontation with the United States.\"  Nonetheless, the \narticle continued, the PLO \"realizes that the United States has a \ngenuine interest in resuming the negotiations as soon as \npossible,\" along with other members of the international \ncommunity.  Moreover, the article argued, \"Israel's position is \nweak,\" thus giving the PLO a chance for \"better political gains \nthan previously offered to it.\"  Under these circumstances, the \narticle concluded, \"it is inevitable that the PLO return to the \nnegotiating table.\"  The PLO, it explained, \"is not in the \nbusiness of revenge governed by instant angry reactions, but is \nseeking a political achievement that may return things to the \nright track and make up for our loss in the negotiations [on the \nDOP] in Davos and Cairo\" (Filistin Al-Thawrah, 13 March). \n   Implications \n   PLO leaders clearly see an opportunity following the Hebron \nmassacre to extract concessions on some issues, most notably \nsettlements, on which they deferred to Israeli demands during \nnegotiations leading to the DOP.  Moreover, they are undoubtedly \nalso concerned that they must be seen to have made significant \npolitical gains before returning to negotiations in order to \nsatisfy angry and skeptical Palestinians in the territories. \n'Arafat has almost certainly decided that he must eventually \ncontinue negotiations on the DOP, but judging by his conduct of \nthe talks leading to the Cairo agreement in February, he will \nseek to prolong the current diplomatic maneuvering until he is \nconvinced he can make no further gains. \n   (AUTHOR: MORTON.

The company has already \ndelivered a small plasma fusion pilot plant (under 100 kilowatts per \nhour fusion capacity) to the Central Research Institute of the \nElectric Power Industry (CRIEPI).  Originally developed to treat ash \nfrom incinerated urban refuse,  plasma fusion technology reduces the \nvolume of waste to one-fifth and the amount of exhaust gas to less \nthan one-thirtieth that produced by combustion.  The compact, \ncylinder-shaped plasma fusion furnace continuously supplies ash and \ngenerates ingots, resulting in a low concentration of nitrogen oxide \nin the exhaust gas.  The furnace's plasma torch provides highly \nefficient heating as well as a choice between transfer-type and non- \ntransfer-type plasma generation.  Various non-flammables such as \nmetals and concrete can be processed simultaneously, and continuous \nprocessing allows the handling of large amounts of material. Plasma- \nfused materials are buried in concrete shields, and exhaust gas is \ntreated with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and \nceramic filters.

(DOKLADY AKADEMII \nNAUK Dec 93; NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 5 Jan 94) Roberta D. 733-6331 \n\n   Lasers \n\n   (Japan) Mitsubishi Electric Corporation has developed a 24-watt \ngreen light laser with twice the power of other Japanese green light \nlasers. It is part of a solid-state laser system that also includes \nan yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser and a potassium titanate \nphosphate crystal element that converts the 1,064-nanometer- \nwavelength infrared (IR) YAG laser light to green laser light with a \nwavelength of 532 nanometers and 24 watts of power. Previous \nattempts by Japanese researchers to achieve conversion to such a \nhigh output level failed because the strong IR radiation caused \ncrystal damage. Mitsubishi claims to have solved this problem by \nlengthening the wavelength conversion element, increasing the YAG \nlaser beam's spot size, and finding the optimal phase matching for \nthe adjoining parts of crystals that form the long wavelength \nconversion element.

The  ESL would also allow Europe to compete in \nthis market with Lockheed's LLV minilauncher, due to enter service \nin late 1994.  CNES  estimates the ESL could launch 1 ton to an \naltitude of 700 kilometers for $20 million, which approximates the \ncost of a comparable launch using the LLV. CNES further estimates \nthe total development cost for the ESL at 1.8 billion francs ($310 \nmillion) over four and a half years. \n\n   COVER GRAPHIC: Color illustration of European Small Launcher \n\n   Although the European Space Agency (ESA) recently began a market \nstudy for a mini launcher, CNES and ASI believe an ESA-sponsored \nmini launcher is neither politically nor financially feasible, and \nthat it will therefore be up to France and Italy to build and \nfinance the project, with contributions from European industry. \nParticipating companies include Aerospatiale and SEP (France), BPD \n(Italy),  DASA (Germany), Contraves (Switzerland), and SABCA \n(Belgium).  (For previous reporting on Aerospatiale's plans to \ncompete in the minilauncher market, see PERSPECTIVES Vol. 8 No. 8, \n31 Aug 93 and Vol. 8 No. 12, 30 Dec 93.) \n\n   CNES and ASI believe the ESL will meet the need for several \nlaunches per year of clusters of 200-to 700-kilogram commercial \ntelecommunications satellites (such as the Iridium and Globalstar \nsystems), to be placed in low-Earth orbit at inclinations of 60 to \n90 degrees; one or more 500-kilogram Earth observation satellites to \nbe placed in sun-synchronous orbit at 800 kilometers; at least one \n200-to 500-kilogram scientific satellite (such as Sweden's Viking \nand Freja);  and military telecommunications or reconnaissance \nsatellites. The ESL will be capable of launching a minimum payload \nof 100 kilograms to any orbit, up to 600 kilograms to a 1,400- \nkilometer orbit, or 1,000 kilograms to a 700-kilometer orbit. With a \ncylindrical volume of 4.8  meters x 2.2 meters, the launcher's \nmaximum payload will be 1.4 to 1.5  tons.  The ESL will attain a \nmaximum altitude of 5,000 kilometers. Launch reliability is expected \nto be 99 percent and the accuracy of payload insertion into orbit \nwill be 4 kilometers on the semimajor axis and 0.01 degree in \ninclination. The single or dual payload will be accommodated in a \nfairing measuring 4.8 meters long with a maximum diameter of 2.2 \nmeters. Acceleration will be 7 g. \n\n   Because CNES believes a low development cost for the launch \nvehicle is critical, the ESL's design incorporates as many existing \ncomponents as possible. The launcher, which measures 25 meters long \nby 2.6 meters in diameter and weighs 121 tons, was built with \ntechnology developed for the Ariane 5.  Its first three stages use \nAriane 5's hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) solid propellant. \nThe launcher's first two stages are identical in size but have \nnozzles adapted for functioning on the ground  (P50 A) or in space \n(P50 B). These first two stages each carries 51.2 tons of HTPB in a \nlightweight carbon-fiber wound casing made using the same technology \nas that used for France's M5 ballistic missile; thrust for these \nstages measures 173 and 190 tons, respectively. The third stage, P7, \ncarries 7.2 tons of HTPB in a carbon-fiber casing measuring 2.3 \nmeters in diameter and has a 23-ton thrust. The fourth stage is a \nliquid-fuel terminal-propulsion module (LM)  housed in the equipment \nbay, which measures 2.6  meters.  This stage provides roll and \nattitude control, final trajectory correction, and orbit \ncircularization. It carries 260 kilograms of hydrazine and its six \nnozzles provide 400 newtons of thrust. \n\n   As an alternative to the P7 solid-fuel third stage, DASA has been \nstudying a liquid-fuel third stage (L5) carrying 5 tons of \nunsymmetrical dimethyl-hydrazine (N(sub)20(sub)4/UDMH).  It uses the \nAestus engine, which is derived from the Ariane 5's L9.7 third stage \nand has a thrust of 27.5  kilonewtons.  Because it would require a \n200-kilogram reduction in payload capacity, DASA's alternative \nprobably will not be used, according to AIR & COSMOS. CNES estimates \n\nthe ESL can be built in four and a half years, and hopes to get \nfinal approval by 1995 in order to begin construction in early 1995 \nand begin flying in mid-1999.  ANSASERVICE (12 Jan 94) reports that \nthe project's definition phase is to be completed by June 1994. \nInitial plans are for two launches per year from the Ariane 5 launch \nplatform in Kourou, French Guiana,  with expectations of increasing \nthe number to between five and ten launches per year. \n\n   Alexis M. 733-6345 \n\n   SOUTH KOREA: 1994 S&T BUDGET, 1993 S&T ACCOMPLISHMENTS \n\n   Key Points:  The South Korean Government's 1994 S&T budget of \nnearly 2 trillion won ($2.5 billion) is the country's largest to \ndate, representing 2.2 percent of the national budget and a 32.7- \npercent increase over last year.

The South \nKorean Government expects patent friction to arise as the product \nline expands. \n\n   Topic Sentence:  Hyundai is developing advanced liquid crystal \ndisplay products through its US subsidiary, while Samsung benefits \nfrom a joint technology agreement with a Japanese firm. \n\n   South Korean electronics companies are investing heavily in thin- \nfilm-transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs),  with a goal of \ntransforming this into the industry's second highest value-added \nproduct after semiconductors, according to the 5 January MAEIL \nKYONGJE SINMUN (MKS). The newspaper reports that South Korea's three \nmajor producers--Goldstar Electron,  the Samsung Group, and Hyundai \nElectronics--in their first three years of work on TFT-LCDs, have \nalready commercialized a number of high-quality  products at the \nsuper video graphic array (VGA) level. \n\n   Goldstar plans to invest 500 billion won ($625 million) in new \nassembly lines to be completed in May 1995 that will have an annual \nproduction of 500,000  3-  to  12.3-inch  units.  In November NIKKEI \nMICRODEVICES reported that $400 million of that investment will go \ntoward the production of 10-inch panels. MKS meanwhile reports that \nGoldstar has become the second company in the world to develop a \nhigh-resolution 12.3-inch LCD  panel.  MKS and NIKKEI report that \nGoldstar will spend an additional $250 million by 1997 to raise its \nannual LCD production capacity to 1 million units. South Korea plans \nto invest another 140 billion won  ($175 million) in R&D to improve \n\nproduct quality \"beyond that of its Japanese competitors,\" according \nto MKS. \n\n   NIKKEI and MKS also report that in 1992 Hyundai began developing \n10.4-inch TFT-LCD color panels at its US research subsidiary, Image \nQuest Technology. It has  completed preparations for trial runs at \nits US pilot plant and expects to begin production in South Korea by \n1995. \n\n   According to the 5 January MKS, Samsung, which is already \nproducing small quantities of TFT-LCDs on a pilot line for use in \nits own notebook PCs, is planning to expand its TFT-LCD production, \nwith the ultimate goal of completely indigenous production. MKS \nreports the group will invest 450 billion won ($562.5 million) in \nLCDs in  1994. The 8 November MKS said that Samsung Electron \nDevices, one of the group's subsidiaries, was investing 300 billion \nwon ($375 million) to increase annual LCD production by 100 percent \nto 2 million units by 1994, and to 5 million units by the year 2000. \n\n   Samsung's efforts to assume a more prominent position in LCD R&D \n\nprobably will be bolstered by cooperation from Japanese industry. \nFor example,  according to the 8 November MKS, Samsung Electron \nDevices was planning to set up a research institute in Japan to \nobtain LCD technology, and to proceed with arrangements for LCD \ntechnology transfer from Japanese companies.  Late last December \nSamsung announced its agreement with Japan's Toshiba to jointly \ndevelop integrated circuits for LCDs by merging its own basic \ntechnology with Toshiba's production technology (MAEIL KYONGJE \nSINMUN 28 Dec 93).  The two companies reportedly will cooperate \nthroughout all stages of development,  from basic standards through \nfinal reliability tests to create a product that \"stands at the \nforefront of world technology.\"  According to MKS, Samsung believes \nthe arrangement will help the company expand sales in the United \nStates, Europe, and Japan, while at the same time helping to \nstrengthen South Korea's  position in the development of nonmemory \nsemiconductors. Tokyo DENPA (28 December 93) reported that work will \nbegin this summer on chips with applications for TFT-LCDs and super- \ntwisted nematic (STN)) LCDs,  and that the two companies will also \nwork to standardize pin  arrangements, which has been an industry \nbottleneck. \n\n   South Korea's move into LCDs is raising concern there about the \nneed to devise \"countermeasures\" in anticipation of a foreign \npatents offensive,\" according to the 13 January MKS. Although LCD- \nrelated patent disputes have not yet surfaced, the newspaper expects \nfriction to arise in 1996 when South Korean firms begin mass- \nproducing advanced devices.  According to the South Korean Patents \nAdministration, foreign patent  applications in this field numbered \n862 between 1976 and 1992, with Swiss, British, and German companies \nalready demanding royalties from South Korea for premium color LCDs, \nTFT-LCDs, and liquid crystal materials. For their part, South Korean \ncompanies have filed 1,350 LCD-related patent applications, most of \nwhich have been for black-and-white equipment, so the industry can \nexpect some \"hard blows,\" MKS predicts.  The newspaper quotes a \nPatents Administration official who urges South Korean firms to \nreduce the potential damage to domestic companies by \"signing \nlicensing agreements beforehand\" for technology about which there is \nconcern over patent infringement.\" \n\n   Commenting on South  Korea's  LCD efforts overall, the 1 December \nSILMUL KYONGJE, a Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade \n(KIET) publication, notes that South Korea's 1992 LCD production \namounted to $88 million or just 2 percent of the world market. \nCurrent investment plans, however, will cause the domestic LCD \nindustry to grow, on average, 51 percent annually between 1994 and \n2001, by which time South Korea will have 14 percent of the world \nmarket and will rank second only to Japan. KIET estimates the level \nof domestic production technology for LCD's at 90 percent that of \nJapan's, although design and basic technology are only about half. \nSouth Korean companies have the technology to mass-produce twisted \nnematic LCDs at 90 percent of Japan's rate, STN LCDs at 40 percent, \nand TFT-LCDs at slightly less than 70 percent of Japan's rate, \naccording to SILMUL KYONGJE. \n\n   KIET says it would like to see South Korean LCD manufacturers \ncooperate in the joint development of components. In 1992, domestic \nfirms reportedly organized a manufacturer's association that has \nfocused its research on displays, which, according to KIET, helped \nreduce  \"overlapping  investment.\"  In KIET's view, however, \ncompetition between South Korean firms will continue to stand in the \nway of joint efforts. NIKKEI MICRODEVICES notes as well that plans \nby Samsung and Goldstar to manufacture their own components for TFT \npanels is at odds with the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy's \npolicy of apportioning parts  and  materials production to small and \nmedium-sized businesses. \n\n   William H. 733-6521 \n\n   REPORTS \n\n   REPORTS surveys science and technology trends as detailed in \narticles, books, and journals.

(HOPE, an unmanned space plane, is to be launched by an H-2 \nrocket in 1999.) The ALFLEX experimental plane is now in the design \nphase and its maiden flight is scheduled for fiscal year 1995. The \nplane's developers have been conducting ground effect tests at the \nGust Wind Tunnel in Chofu Airfield Branch since June 1993, in order \nto assess the plane's aerodynamic behavior during high-speed landing \nand at high angles of attack during flare. \n\n   GRAPHIC: Color Drawing \n\n   CAPTION: ALFLEX experimental plane \n\n   GRAPHIC: Line Drawing \n\n   CAPTION: ALFLEX experiment \n\n   According to a report in KOGIKEN NYUSU (Sep 93), engineers are \nusing rapid prototyping techniques to construct wind tunnel models \nout of photosetting resin using data generated with three- \ndimensional computer-aided design.  Using off-the-shelf technology \ndeveloped for industrial robots,  NAL has built a six-degree-of- \nfreedom robot with a 150-kilogram load capacity that functions as a \nsupport structure and positioning system for the wind tunnel test \nmodels. The ALFLEX test model is attached to the sting at the tip of \nthe robot arm, allowing adjustments in angle of attack, yaw, and \nroll. Variation in the positioning of the models is less than 0.1 \nmillimeter and variation in the re-creation of positions is 0.5 \nmillimeter. \n\n   GRAPHIC: Line Drawing \n\n   CAPTION: ALFLEX wind tunnel test model \n\n   During the wind tunnel ground effect tests, researchers took 10 \nmeasurements of variation in lift and drag after making incremental \nchanges in the model's altitude relative to a plate simulating the \nground. In the dynamic test,  measurements were made while the model \nwas being moved continuously from the highest altitude to the lowest \naltitude (KOGIKEN NYUSU Sep  93; NATIONAL AEROSPACE LABORATORY 1993- \n1994 Oct 93). \n\n   Junko A. 733-6346 \n\n      JAPAN: NEC DEVELOPS SEMICONDUCTOR LASER WITH LOW OPERATING \nCURRENT \n\n   Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. (NEC) has developed a new type of \nsemiconductor laser that begins to emit infrared radiation when \nstimulated by an electric current of 190 microamperes, according to \na report in NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN (5 Jan 94). This amperage--the \nworld's lowest operating current--is reported to be less than one \ntenth the current used by conventional semiconductor lasers and NEC \nexpects it to lead to a large reduction in electric power \nconsumption by high-speed optoelectric integrated circuit devices \nused in optical communications and optical computers. \n\n   The NEC laser is a \"sandwich\" of crystalline film layers stacked \non a substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. Infrared radiation with a \nwavelength of 1 micron generated in the optically active middle \nlayer is emitted from the top surface of the laser in a direction \nperpendicular to the substrate instead of horizontally from the side \nof the laser, as is the case with conventional semiconductor lasers. \nUnlike the latter, the NEC laser is easily focused and can be \nintegrated with optoelectronic devices, in a fashion analagous to an \nordinary transistor. \n\n   In experiments the NEC laser began to emit radiation when the \ninjection current reached 190 microamperes.  When the current was \nraised to 2 milliamperes, optical output power reached 50 \nmicrowatts. The NEC researchers kept radiation loss to a minimum by \nmaking the thickness of the active layer equal to the radiation \nwavelength. The laser is limited to pulsed emission operation, but \nNEC intends to develop a method to reduce the laser element's \nresistance in order to make it suitable for continuous emission. \n\n   John H. 733-6341 \n\n   JAPAN: QUANTUM BOX LASER \n\n   The Tokyo Institute of Technology has conducted experiments at \n-196 degrees C on a quantum box laser that generates pulses of \ninfrared radiation at a wavelength of 1.3 microns and requires only \n1.3 amperes of current for oscillation. The laser element consists \nof a plane-surface indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) film with many \nmicroscopic particles of InGaAs arranged in a grid pattern and \nembedded in the film. The particles are 70 nanometers apart and each \nis 30 nanometers in diameter and 12 nanometers thick. The InGaAs- \nfilm laser element is sandwiched between insulating layers of indium \nphosphide. Unlike electrons in the thin-film layers of conventional \nsemiconductor lasers, electrons confined in the point-like particle \nboxes of the new laser cannot move in any dimension, so they can \nemit radiation with virtually no waste, according to the \nresearchers. \n\n   After development is complete the laser is expected to perform at \nroom temperature.  Researchers believe the ultrahigh radiation \nefficiency will make it possible to operate it using only a few \ntenths of the electric power required by conventional \nsemiconductors. The institute expects that the new laser will be \nused in optical communications and optical computers because it \nconsumes little power and generates little heat, even when several \nlasers are grouped together (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 19 Nov 93). \n\n   John H. 733-6341 \n\n   FRANCE: RESEARCH ON LOW-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY \n\n   Two groups of French researchers are focusing their research and \ndevelopment efforts on low-temperature superconductors that operate \nat temperatures between -63 degrees C and 7 degrees C. For example, \nresearchers at the Paris School for Advanced Physics and Industrial \nChemistry have developed semiconductors that exhibit \nsuperconductivity at -23 degrees C, according to IL SOLE-24 ORE (11 \nJan 94). The semiconductor is composed of five to 10 layers of \ncopper oxide produced using molecular beam epitaxy deposition \ntechniques at low temperatures.  Possible applications are in \nelectronics and computers. \n\n   In related research, a team from two National Scientific Research \nCenter (CNRS) laboratories in  Grenoble--the  Center for Research on \nVery Low Temperatures and the Crystallography Laboratory--has \nobserved superconductivity in mercury cuprate compounds at \ntemperatures ranging from -63 degrees  C  to  7 degrees C, at normal \npressure. According to AFP SCIENCES (23 Dec 93), this breakthrough \nfollows the team's September 1993 experiment, which achieved \nsuperconductivity at 157 K and 245 kilobars of pressure, and which \ndemonstrated that critical temperature rises at the rate of 0.05 K \nper kilobar as the atomic density of cuprates increases with \nincreasing pressure. (Previous research  achieved the same result by \nreplacing certain atoms in a compound with others.) The experimental \nsamples were 10 cubic millimeters in size and consisted of mercury, \nbarium, calcium, and copper oxide phases.  A dramatic drop in \nelectrical resistance was observed in seven samples and diamagnetism \nwas observed in 15 samples, at temperatures ranging from 190 K to \n280 K depending on the compound, with the highest critical \ntemperature occurring in 1 percent of the sample. Future research \nwill focus on identifying the structure of that portion of the \nsample. \n\n   Alexis M./Wendy P. (Brussels Bureau) 733-6339 \n\n   RUSSIA: ANTICANCER, POTENTIAL AIDS DRUG PATENTED \n\n   In June 1993 Russian  officials granted four patents to a Russian \nchemist who developed Viturid, an immunostimulant said to be ten \ntimes more effective against second-  and third-stage cancers than \ncurrent US and Russian therapies for the disease. After declining an \noffer from a US hospital to conduct clinical trials of the \npharmaceutical in exchange for rights to its use, the scientist \nfounded her own testing firm in the United States but later returned \nto Russia following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. \nClinical trials in Russia showed that malignant tumors became benign \nand ultimately regressed completely following treatment with \nViturid.  The drug's developer also claims it is effective in \ntreating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prior to the onset of \nimmunodeficiency. Russian Health Minister Nechayev has authorized \ndoctors to begin treating some unspecified diseases with Viturid in \norder to finance further testing (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 6 Jan 94). \n\n   Roberta D. 733-6331 \n\n   JAPAN: SYNCHROTRON ORBITAL RADIATION FACILITY FOR CIRCUIT ETCHING \n\n   Mitsubishi Electric has completed construction of a synchrotron \norbital radiation (SOR) facility designed for circuit etching of \nfuture-generation semiconductor chips.  It includes a linear \naccelerator, a synchrotron, and an accumulator ring for the storage \nof electrons after they have been accelerated to relativistic \nspeeds. Superconducting electromagnets in the ring are used to \ndeflect the electrons from their orbit, thereby causing them to emit \nthe intense radiation required for the ultrafine processing of \nfuture-generation 256-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) \nchips. The compact SOR facility, which cost several billion yen, is \ndesigned to supply radiation simultaneously to 20 processing units. \nThe circumference of the electron beam orbit in the SOR ring is only \n9.2 meters, and the amount of liquid  helium required to cool the \nsuperconducting coils is reported to be only a \"fraction\" of the \namount necessary for conventional SOR facilities. Mitsubishi, which \nis currently using the SOR facility for the development of \nsemiconductors within the company, is also planning to market it \nexternally (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 Nov 93). \n\n   John H. 733-6341 \n\n   SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS \n\n   JAPAN: SPACE INDUSTRY \n\n      A special issue of the JPRS report series SCIENCE & \nTECHNOLOGY/JAPAN entitled \"New  Outlook for Space Industry\" (JPRS- \nJST-94-009-L, 22 Feb 94) includes the views of MITI officials and \ncorporate executives on the outlook for Japan's space industry. \n\n   Parker H. 733-6336 \n\n   JAPAN: NATIONAL AEROSPACE LABORATORY \n      A special issue of the JPRS report series SCIENCE & \nTECHNOLOGY/JAPAN entitled \"National Aerospace Laboratory (1993- \n1994),\" (JPRS-JST-93-025, 22 Nov 93), provides information on NAL's \nbudget, personnel, and current high-priority research projects. \n\n   Junko A. 733-6346 \n\n   JAPAN: AIRCRAFT COMPUTATIONAL AERODYNAMICS \n\n      A  special  issue   of   the  JPRS  report  series  SCIENCE  & \n\nTECHNOLOGY/JAPAN entitled \"Selections  from  the  Proceedings of the \n9th NAL Symposium on Aircraft Computational Aerodynamics\" (JPRS-JST- \n94-002, 7 Feb  94) presents research from the National Aerospace \nLaboratory. \n\n   Parker H. 733-6336 \n\n   JAPAN: NUCLEAR POWER DATABASES \n\n      A special issue of the JPRS report series SCIENCE & \nTECHNOLOGY/JAPAN entitled  \"Nuclear Power Technology Database and \nInformation Network Systems\" (JPRS-JST-94-003-L, 18 Jan 94) provides \nselected articles from GENSHIRYOKU KOGYO, a monthly nuclear \nengineering magazine, on nuclear-related databases including \nATOMNET, NUCLEN, NUCIS, SANTA, NICS, and DATA FREEWAY. \n\n   Junko A. 733-6346 \n\n   GERMANY: BMFT SUBSIDIES \n\n   A translation of a report from the German Federal Ministry for \nResearch and Technology (BMFT) entitled \"Information Technology \nSubsidy Program 1993-1996\" was recently published as a special issue \nof the JPRS report series SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EUROPE/INTERNATIONAL \n\n(JPRS-EST-93-040, 1 Dec 93).

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n                                None of the leaders of the former Yugoslavia, whether Serb, \nMuslim, or Croat, has expressed any interest in seeing the Serbs \njoin the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina that \nwas called for in the 1 March Washington agreement.  Serbian \nleaders, while rejecting a federation, have suggested forming a \nconfederation loosely linking the Serb entities, Croatia and the \nproposed federation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia.  However, \nCroatian and Muslim leaders have rejected any confederal \nrelations between Bosnia and the so-called Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (FRY, Serbia and Montenegro). \n                                     END SUMMARY \n   Having already expressed their strong opposition to joining the \nproposed Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, \nBosnian Serb leaders, along with the Serbs of Croatia, are \npressing for at minimum a confederation of all Serb-populated \nterritories in former Yugoslavia.  Serb leaders in Bosnia and \nCroatia have reiterated their longstanding claims that their \nrespective territories never seceded from Yugoslavia--as did the \nBosnian and Croatian republics--and thus have the right to remain \nunited with the FRY.  For example, Nikola Koljevic, \"vice \npresident\" of the so-called Republic of Srpska (RS), demanded the \nright for the Bosnian Serbs to have \"very close links\" with the \nFRY since, \"legally speaking,\" they \"never left Yugoslavia\" \n(Belgrade radio, 14 March).  Similarly, Milan Martic, \"president\" \nof the so-called Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in Croatia, \nmaintaining that the RSK never seceded from Yugoslavia, has \ncalled for establishing \"everlasting connections with the FRY\" \n(Politika, 10 March).  This apparently represents a significant \nand possibly coordinated shift in emphasis, since leaders of both \nentities had recently emphasized their contrary claims that their \n\"republics\" should be recognized as separate, sovereign states. \n   The Bosnian Serbs have not ruled out some type of future \npolitical links with the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia- \nHerzegovina and Croatia.  Bosnian Serb \"President\" Radovan \nKaradzic suggested that the RS is willing to consider \"broader \nintegration\" of the territories of former Yugoslavia, broaching \nthe idea of joining Croatia and the FRY together \"into some \nrelationship\" with the RS and the RSK (Tanjug, 14 March). \nSimilarly, although Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Bosnian \nSerb assembly, described the prospect of the Serbs joining the \nMuslim-Croatian federation as \"unnatural, illogical, and \nunacceptable,\" he said the Serbs would \"accept\" talks on a \n\"future modality\" for linking the three peoples (Tanjug, 12 \nMarch). \n   At the same time, another Bosnian Serb official set conditions \nfor joining the negotiations on the fate of Bosnia-Herzegovina \nthat would almost preclude Serb participation.  After delivering \nwhat Krajisnik said would be the \"official\" Serb position to \nRussian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin in Belgrade on 14 March \n(Tanjug, 13 March), Koljevic insisted that the Serbs would \nparticipate in talks with the Croats and Muslims only \"on an \nequal footing, which would mean without sanctions\" on the FRY. \n(Belgrade radio, 14 March).  Suggesting that he would prefer to \nsee the Washington agreement derailed, Karadzic has called for a \nreturn to the Geneva negotiations, with the EU taking the lead \nback from the United States (Tanjug, 15 March). \n   Belgrade's Stance \n   Although the leadership of the FRY, including Serbian President \nSlobodan Milosevic, has not rejected the Washington agreement out \nof hand, Belgrade has not indicated any willingness to negotiate \nwithin the terms of the plan.  Milosevic stopped just short of \nrejecting the plan after talking with Greek Foreign Minister \nKarolos Papoulias, releasing a statement that made no mention of \nthe plan but endorsed a peace settlement based on the November \n1993 European Union plan for a union of three sovereign states in \nBosnia-Herzegovina (Tanjug, 11 March).  At the same time, \napparently not wanting to be held responsible for rejecting the \nWashington agreement, Milosevic maintained what Churkin called a \n\"flexible attitude\" toward a Bosnian settlement at their 14 March \nmeeting, a point that was stressed on Milosevic-controlled \nBelgrade television (Belgrade TV, 14 March).  Other comments from \nYugoslav leaders and media have reiterated the position that the \nSerbs do not oppose a Muslim-Croatian federation as long as it \ndoes not threaten Serbian interests, while at the same time \nexpressing skepticism that such a federation can long survive \n(Belgrade radio, 3 March; Belgrade TV, 12 March). \n   Bosnian Government Stand \n   The Bosnian Government has rejected Serbian proposals for \nconfederal ties linking Bosnia-Herzegovina with the FRY and \ninsisted that the Serbs will not be allowed to alter the borders \nof the country by seceding with the territory they control. \nWhile inviting the Serbs to sign on to the Washington agreement, \nPresident Alija Izetbegovic flatly declared during an interview \nwith Zagreb television that a confederation between Bosnia- \nHerzegovina and the FRY is \"out of the question.\"  He also warned \nthat the Serbs would not be allowed to \"snatch away part of \nBosnia and attach it to Serbia.\"  Although he did not rule out \nthe possibility of \"certain forms of cooperation\"--specifically \n\"economic cooperation\" --between the states of the former \nYugoslavia, he contended that no \"serious, responsible people\" \nwere considering the creation of a \"new Yugoslavia\" (Zagreb TV, 9 \nMarch). \n   Croatia's Stance \n   The Croatian Government has also rejected the possibility of \nconfederal ties between the FRY and either Croatia or Bosnia- \nHerzegovina.  Asked about Krajisnik's proposal to link the \nSerbian \"states\" with Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Foreign \nMinister Mate Granic flatly declared it \"absolutely impossible\" \nto accept.  He further stressed that \"under no circumstances\" \nwould Croatia consider \"any kind of relationship\" linking it \n\"directly or indirectly\" with the FRY.  Attributing the proposal \nto Churkin, Granic said that he had conveyed his negative views \n\"very firmly\" to both the Russians and the Bosnian Government \n(Zagreb TV, 13 March).  Although President Franjo Tudjman has not \ndirectly rejected ties between the Bosnian state and the FRY, he \ndid offhandedly dismiss the idea during a 7 March press \nconference in responding to a question on the subject (Zagreb \nradio, 7 March). \n   Implications \n   The Croat and Bosnian Governments' refusal to accept a confederal \nrelationship between the Bosnian Serbs and the FRY appears to \ndoom any possibility, however remote, that the Serbs will agree \nto the Washington plan.  In the near term, the Serbs are likely \nto continue combat operations to secure territory linking their \nenclaves into one entity, with the aim of declaring the new lines \nof demarcation to be the borders of their republic.  Although \nthey may be willing to make territorial concessions in exchange \nfor concessions from the Bosnian Government and the international \ncommunity--particularly lifting the UN sanctions on Belgrade- \n-they are likely to continue to pursue the goal of eventual union \nwith the FRY and the RSK. \n   (AUTHOR:  NASH.

Similarly, Seoul's  KBS-I radio the same day cited the \nIAEA team as reporting that compared with past inspections, there \nhad been \"improvement\" in inspection activities allowed during \nthe IAEA team's latest visit.  However, the team could not \nextract enough samples to prove definitively whether or not North \nKorea had diverted nuclear materials for uses other than what it \nhad declared, according to the radio. \n   Not surprisingly, Pyongyang is pursuing an equally minimalist \nstrategy in its talks with South Korea.  Pyongyang radio on 16 \nMarch accused Seoul of attempting to obstruct upcoming DPRK-U.S. \nhigh-level talks by blocking progress at the latest round of \ninter-Korean talks.  According to the radio, at the latest round \nthe North adhered to its \"reasonable\" insistence that the sides \nissue a joint communique declaring their basic intent to realize \nan exchange of special envoys at an early date.  Pyongyang radio \nalso asserted that the South had refused to accept the North's \nversion of a draft agreement on procedural matters and claimed \nthat Seoul is \"deliberately\" creating difficulties, bent on \n\"putting the brakes\" on DPRK-U.S. talks, tentatively set to start \nin Geneva on 21 March. \n   Pyongyang seems to be calculating that by making limited \nconcessions at the North-South talks, it can cast the South in \nthe role of obstructing the planned talks with Washington.  For \nexample, according to Pyongyang radio accounts of the 16 March \nmeeting, the North Korean chief delegate juxtaposed the North's \n\"broad-minded and epoch-making\" willingness to lift four demands \nthat North Korea previously advanced in the talks to the South's \n\"sanctimonious\" rejection of North Korean proposals. \n   Interest in Foreign Trade     Despite its stance on IAEA \ninspections and North-South contacts, Pyongyang also seems to be \ntempering its hardline stance by carefully signaling that its \nlong-term goal is to reach a peaceful settlement of the nuclear \nissue.  To this end, the North Korean news agency KCNA waited \nuntil 15 March--the day a Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a \nthreatening statement about U.S. preconditions on DPRK-U.S. \ntalks--to publicize a set of free trade zone regulations that had \nbeen adopted on 21 February.  The regulations concern the \noperation of foreign businesses within North Korean free trade \nzones.  Similarly, the next day KCNA reported on regulations, \nalso adopted on 21 February, for the implementation of the tax \nlaw on foreign enterprises.  Both sets of trade regulations \npresuppose an influx of foreign investment into North Korea, an \nevent not likely to occur without a peaceful resolution of the \nnuclear issue. \n   Implications     Pyongyang media treatment of recent developments \nconcerning the nuclear issue suggests that the North Korean \nleadership may believe that it has already given Washington \nenough incentives so that it would not be willing to risk the \nheightening of tensions on the Korean peninsula by breaking off \nU.S.-DPRK talks.  Pyongyang appears to be trying to retain as \nmuch of its \"nuclear card\" and control over the inter-Korean \nissues as possible in order to enhance its position at any future \nbilateral negotiations with Washington. \n   (AUTHOR:  YIM.

Activity by parties varies \nwidely--strong in Lviv and Donetsk but weak in many other places. \nWith nationalist and democratic parties likely to run well in the \nwest, leftist and liberal parties in the east, but non-party \ncandidates likely to win the most seats nationwide, prospects are \nfor a badly splintered Supreme Soviet with weak parties and \nlittle ability to resolve the country's tough problems. \n                                     END SUMMARY \n   Easy filing requirements and lax filing deadlines contributed to \nthe flood of candidates.  According to the election law, \ncandidates had to file only 10 signatures by 60 days before the \nelection (late January) to become a \"candidate for candidate\" and \nthen 300 signatures by 45 days before the election (i.e., 10 \nFebruary) to become a registered candidate (Vidomosti Verkhovnoi \nRady Ukrainy, 30 November 1993).  Although plenty of candidates \nhad already qualified, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) \nallowed registration to continue after 10 February (Nezavisimost, \n11 February), apparently until individual local electoral \ncommissions decided to close it.  Robitnycha Hazeta reported on \n18 February that registration had ended in 211 of the 450 \ndistricts, and Holos Ukrainy reported on 23 February that all \nregistration had finally ended on 17 February.  In late February \nthe CEC reported that 5,833 (86 percent) of the 6,750 \"candidates \nfor candidate\" had been registered as final candidates (Holos \nUkrainy, 2 March).  The lists of candidates began appearing in \nlocal papers in mid-February, and candidates began appearing on \nlocal television in groups--for example, the 16 candidates for \nKiev city district no. 14 were slated to make the first joint \nappearance on 14 February (Vecherniy Kiev, 12 February). \n   Parties' Role Limited \n   Parties played a limited role in putting forward candidates, \nformally nominating only a small percentage of the candidates in \nmost districts.  Groups of voters nominated 3,633 (62 percent), \nwork collectives 1,557 (27 percent), while parties nominated only \n643 (11 percent), according to the 2 March Holos Ukrainy. \nHowever, some areas, such as Lviv and Donetsk, had a much higher \nproportion of party nominees than the republic-wide 11 percent \n(See Box 1). \n   In reality, however, there are far more party-affiliated \ncandidates on the ballot than party nominations would indicate \nbecause some who were identified with a party in local papers \nwere nominated by groups of electors or collectives.  In Kiev \nOblast, only 12 candidates were nominated by parties, but 46 \ncandidates actually belong to parties (Kiyvska Pravda, 28 \nJanuary).  And in Donetsk, lists of candidates for the first 10 \ndistricts in Vecherniy Donetsk identified one third to one half \nof the candidates in most districts as affiliated with parties, \nfar more than the number nominated by parties. \n   At the same time, not all candidates affiliated with a party are \nendorsed as candidates by the party.  A DemPU (Democratic Party \nof Ukraine) candidate is running against former Defense Minister \nKostyantyn Morozov in Kiev district No. 1 but DemPU itself is \nbacking Morozov (Samostiyna Ukraina, 23-28 February). \n   So far, no parties have published republic-wide lists of their \ncandidates, and though several publicly set a goal of running \ncandidates in all districts, it appears none came close.  Few \nparties have even provided numbers of their candidates.  The \npaper Rada (published by Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil) on 3 \nMarch carried an article reporting that Rukh members were running \nin 260 of the 450 districts and that there also were dozens of \nindependent candidates \"who support Rukh and promise to join \nRukh's faction if elected.\"  The URP's paper Samostiyna Ukraina \n(23-28 February) reported that the URP had registered 132 \ncandidates (including 17 in Lviv, 17 in Kiev, 10 in Ternopil, and \n8 in Ivano-Frankivsk), while the DemPU was running fewer \n(including only 6 in Kiev city).  The Post-Postup News Agency \nreported that a 24 January UNA (Ukrainian National Assembly) \npress conference announced 60 candidates (15 in Kiev, 15 in \nPoltava and Cherkassy, 12 in Donbass, 4 in Rivne, 3 in Kiev \nOblast, 2 in Odesa, Ternopil, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Vinnytsa). \nThe Central Electoral Commission announced that the CPU was \nrunning the most candidates--6.7 percent of all, followed by Rukh \n(4.1 percent), SPU (3.11 percent), URP (2.42 percent), Liberal \nParty (1.43 percent), and DemPU (1.28 percent), but that there \nwere also many \"hidden\" party candidates (Holos Ukrainy, \nNezavisimaya Gazeta, 4 March; Demokratychna Ukraina, 5 March). \n   Joint Candidacies \n   Another of the reasons for the limited number of party-nominated \ncandidates may be agreement among parties to back each others' \ncandidates to avoid fratricidal contests between like-minded \nparties.  In the initial months after announcement of the \nelection, success at uniting parties behind candidates was very \nlimited.  More recently, Levko Lukyanenko, head of the \"Ukraine\" \nDemocratic Union (the latest name for the coordinating organ set \nup by democratic parties in December), has claimed that \ndemocratic parties have made great progress in agreeing on \ncandidates.  He said at a February press conference that \ndemocratic parties had \"agreed on a single candidate\" in over 320 \nof the 450 districts (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 February).  In another \nversion of his remarks--given in the 22 February Silski Visti and \n23 February Khreshchatyk--he reportedly said there were \"agreed\" \ncandidates in 342 districts.  He named candidates in 6 Kiev \nOblast districts that the \"Ukraine\" union would back with both \norganizational and financial support (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 \nFebruary). \n   Rukh Chairman and longtime Lukyanenko foe Vyacheslav Chornovil \ntook a more pessimistic view than Lukyanenko of democratic \nparties' success in uniting behind agreed candidates.  In a 15 \nFebruary Sribna Zemlya interview, Chornovil said that the \n\"Ukraine\" union was mainly just Rukh, the URP, and DemPU.  The \nPDVU, New Ukraine, social democrats, liberal democrats, christian \ndemocrats, and the \"left center\" had not joined, he said.  He \nalso complained that in Lviv the URP had fielded too many \ncandidates. \n   Moreover, even Lukyanenko admitted that democrats had been unable \nto agree on candidates in 38 districts--mainly in Lviv, Ivano- \nFrankivsk, and Ternopil (Silski Visti, 22 February).  In these \nareas, where democrats are virtually sure to win, they apparently \nfelt less need to unite and more opportunity to win on their own. \nWhen the Lviv democratic coordinating council finally announced \nits list of candidates, it was able to endorse an agreed \ncandidate in only 2 of the 23 districts; in the rest it endorsed \nmore than one candidate or noted that some member-parties were \nbacking candidates other than the council's (Vysokyy Zamok, 5 \nMarch).  Lukyanenko also acknowledged that democrats had been \nunable to field any candidates in 18 districts, mainly in the \neast--5 in Odesa, 4 in Donetsk, 4 in Luhansk, 2 in Zaporizhzhya, \n2 in Krym, and 1 in Poltava (Khreshchatyk, 23 February). \n   Prospects Vary in Regions \n   Lists of candidates and reports on party activity in local Kiev, \nLviv, and Donetsk papers provide a sample of the varied and \ncomplex picture in Ukraine's regions. \n   Kiev \n   Party strength among candidates for Kiev city's 23 seats is hard \nto measure because in listing candidates local papers often \nfailed to indicate if candidates were associated with a party. \nAmong the few candidates identified with parties in the papers, 8 \nwere from the CPU, 6 from the SPU, 5 from Rukh, 5 from the PDVU, \n3 from the UNA, 3 from the tJKRP (Ukrainian Conservative \nRepublican Party), and only 1 from the URP and the Liberal Party, \nand none from DemPU or New Ukraine.  Fifty-eight were \nspecifically identified as nonpartisan.  Most of the rest of the \nalmost 500 candidates listed in the paper Khreshchatyk were not \nidentified with any party or even identified as nonpartisan. \n   Although few Kiev candidates bear the Rukh label, Rukh should win \nsome seats because it has some big names--Chairman of the Supreme \nSoviet's democratic faction, Narodna Rada, Ivan Zayets, outspoken \nRukh leader Serhiy Holovatyy, and Minister of Environmental \nProtection Yuriy Kostenko.  Democrats in general should do well \nsince some of their prominent candidates look like easy winners- \n-former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, city soviet chairman \nVasyl Nesterenko, popular maverick Kiev leader Ivan Saliy (who \nwas fired by Kravchuk as presidential representative for the \ncity), outspoken Vecherniy Kiev editor Vitaliy Karpenko, and \neconomic reformer and former Deputy Premier and Minister of \nEconomy Volodymyr Lanovyy.   Morozov, Karpenko, Zayets, \nHolovatyy, and Kostenko were endorsed by several nationalist \ndemocratic organizations (Vecherniy Kiev, 6 January).  Democratic \nparties could not reach agreement on single candidates in many \ndistricts, however.  When the \"Ukraine\" Democratic Union issued \nits list of approved candidates, it endorsed candidates for only \n14 of the city's 23 districts (Vecherniy Kiev, 10 March). \n   In general, though, Kiev city appears likely to produce fewer \nprominent deputies than in the past.  Many big names on the \nincumbent Kiev Supreme Soviet delegation are running for \nreelection in other regions where they apparently rate their \nchances for election better.  VNRU (National Rukh of Ukraine--the \nanti-Chornovil Rukh) leader Larysa Skoryk and Rukh leader Les \nTanyuk are running in Lviv, democrat Pavlo Movchan in Ivano- \nFrankivsk, former Premier Vi told Fokin in Cherkassy, and URP \nleader Oles Shevchenko in Kiev 'Oblast.  Lukyanenko complained \nthat too many Kiev democrats were running in the west, where it \nis easier to win (Kiyvska Pravda, Khreshchatyk, 22 February)- \n-although Kiev city has also been relatively receptive to \ndemocrats in the past, since 17 of the 22 deputies elected from \nKiev city in 1990 joined the democrats' Narodna Rada shortly \nafter the election. \n   Lviv \n   Lviv will remain the main stronghold for democrats and \nnationalists.  Its present delegation has many prominent \ndemocrats and nationalists--Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, UKRP \nchairman Stepan Khmara, former Deputy Premier for economic reform \nViktor Pynzenyk, former First Deputy Premier Ihor Yukhnovskyy, \nRukh Chairman Chornovil, city Mayor Mykola Horyn, nationalist \nIryna Kalinets, and PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv.  Now, with others \nfrom outside--Skoryk, Tanyuk, prominent Rukh economist Volodymyr \nChernyak, and Rukh Deputy Chairman Oleksandr Lavrynovych added, \nthe field has become crowded.  Despite Lukyanenko's complaint \nthat Kievites are running in Lviv because it is easier to win \nthere, Tanyuk reportedly dropped out of a Kiev race to clear the \nway for an URP candidate (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January), probably \nas part of efforts to coordinate candidacies.  Rukh Chairman \nChornovil actually went against the trend, deciding to run in \nTernopil, not Lviv, this time.  He explained that he was not \nrunning in Lviv district 266 in order to help clear the way for \nelection of Rukh candidate Mykhaylo Boychyshyn (who was kidnapped \na few weeks ago and is still missing) or in district 267 to make \nway for Tanyuk (Kievskiye Novosti, 18 February). \n   Rukh, URP, and New Wave have coordinated some candidates, and \ndemocratic candidates are prominent enough to probably win on the \nfirst ballot in several Lviv districts.  Probable first round \nwinners include Yukhnovskyy (New Wave), Pynzenyk (New Wave), \nTanyuk (Rukh), Chernyak (Rukh), Lavrynovych (Rukh), Ihor Hryniv \n(backed by New Wave, Rukh, and the PDVU--Vysokyy Zamok, 11, 20 \nJanuary, 3 February; Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 12 January), Lviv tJRP \nChairman Oleh Pavlyshyn, Lviv Rukh Chairman Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy, \nand Supreme Soviet member Mykhaylo Kosiv (backed by Rukh, New \nWave, URP, and other organizations--Vysokyy Zamok, 5 February; \nRada, 10 February). \n   In contrast, the many extreme nationalist candidates (KUN, OUN, \nUNA, UKRP, and SNPU) will probably splinter the ultranationalist \nvote.  These parties appeared to make little attempt to \ncoordinate, with the SNPU (Social National Party of Ukraine) \nnominating 21 candidates for Lviv's 23 districts (Kievskiye \nVedomosti, 5 March), KUN 14 (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January) and the \nUKRP 9 (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 5 January). \n   District races in Lviv include some notable contests between \nprominent figures, sometimes pitting democrats against \nultranationalists:  URP Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn is facing \ncontroversial ultranationalist UKRP Chairman Stepan Khmara in \ndistrict no. 261; PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv opposes KUN leader \nIryna Kalynets in district no. 273; and oblast soviet Chairman \nMykola Horyn (Rukh) is running against UNA leader and commander \nof UNA's paramilitary arm UNS0 (Ukrainian National Self-Defense) \nOleh Vitovych in district no. 275. \n   Donetsk \n   Judging by identifications in the Donetsk press, leftist parties \n(CPU, SPU, and the Party of Labor) and the more centrist Liberal \nParty and Party of Justice have been the most active in \nnominating candidates, while Rukh has some candidates, but few \nPDVU, URP, DemPU, or ultranationalists are running.  The 138 \ncandidates for the 10 districts (listed in Vecherniy Donetsk on \n19 February) include 11 Liberal Party affiliated candidates, 9 \nCPU, 8 SPU, 5 Party of Labor, and 5 Party of Justice, but only 3 \nRukh, 2 KUN, 1 URP, 1 DemPU, and 1 PDVU.  Holos Ukrainy on 8 \nFebruary said the largest number of the party candidates in \nDonetsk are Communists and Liberals, followed by the Party of \nLabor, but most candidates were nominated by groups of electors. \nCPU leaders Petro Symonenko and Yevhen Marmazov are running here \n(Pravda Ukrainy, 18 January). \n   Democrats, at least nationalist democrats, are clearly weak in \nDonetsk.  Lukyanenko said that there are few democrats running in \ngeneral and none at all in 4 Donetsk districts (Khreshchatyk, 23 \nFebruary).  Post-Postup reported a 15 January Rukh conference had \nmanaged to nominate 12 candidates for Donetsk's 47 districts. \nThe lists of candidates, at least in the first 10 districts, not \nonly showed few Rukh, URP, and DemPU candidates, but also few or \nno candidates from the non-nationalist democratic parties or \nblocs that should be strong in the east--New Ukraine, PDVU, the \nLabor Congress of Ukraine, and the Interregional Bloc for Reform \nset up by former Premier Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet \nDeputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov, which appears active in \nKharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk. \n   A new local Donetsk bloc has also sprung up recently and \nnominated many candidates.  The \"People's Congress of Donetsk,\" \nwhich backs Ukrainian independence but opposes what it calls the \npresent \"speculative anarchy\" and wants more state control and \nsocial protection for the public, registered candidates in most \nDonetsk districts, according to a 3 February Demokratychna \nUkraina article. \n   Dangers in Electoral Process \n   The large number of candidates and limited ability of parties to \norganize support for candidates and provide some sort of order to \nthe competition indicates there may be few winners on the first \nballot, necessitating runoffs in many districts.  To win, a \ncandidate has to get over 50 percent of the votes cast and votes \nof at least 25 percent of registered voters (according to the \nelection law in the Vidomosti, 30 November 1993).  For the \nelection itself to be valid, 50 percent of the registered voters \nhave to vote, according to the Ukrainian law.  These requirements \napply to all rounds of balloting.  If no candidate qualifies as a \nwinner on the first round, the two highest vote-getters run in a \nrunoff, which must be held within two weeks after the first \nround.  In the 12 December Russian parliamentary election, only a \nplurality was needed, so almost all seats were filled on the \nfirst ballot. \n   In addition to the difficulty of getting enough voters out to \nvote and of candidates garnering a majority of the votes cast, \nthe voting procedures may produce many invalid votes, which also \ncould prevent anyone winning.  As in past elections, voters have \nto cross off all candidates except the one they wish to vote for. \nWith 25 or 30 candidates in many districts, the voter has to \ncross off a large number of names, and if he inadvertently leaves \nmore than one name not crossed off, the ballot will be invalid. \nIf a voter crosses off all names, his vote is valid, however.  In \nthe 12 December Russian election, Russia changed over to positive \nvoting, whereby voters put a mark only by the names of those they \nwished to vote for. \n   The prospect of many runoffs has led to concern that voters will \nlose interest and too few will vote in the second round to meet \nthe requirements for a valid election or that even in the runoff \nno one will win a majority (if a substantial number of voters \ncross out both candidates).  In this case, the election rules \nprovide for new elections within a month of the original election \nin which all candidates in the original election would be barred \n(Vidomosti, 30 November 1993).  With the need to quickly come up \nwith new candidates who had not participated earlier, it seems \nlikely that the quality of the candidates would decline and voter \ninterest may drop further, producing more invalid elections and \nleaving many seats unfilled--perhaps even enough to prevent the \nformation of a new Supreme Soviet. \n   Outlook \n   Although most news reporting on the Ukrainian elections has \nfocused on the activity of parties and their candidates, most \ncandidates are unaffiliated, and presumably they will win most \nseats, especially in rural areas where parties are weakest.  Many \nof these unaffiliated may be conservative-leaning representatives \nof interest groups, lobbies, or behind-the-scenes power \nstructures.  While democrats are strong in west Ukraine, they \nappear to have little organization or support in much of the rest \nof the country, further adding to the prospect for returning a \nconservative legislature.  There is also a danger that low voter \nturnout could void the balloting in enough districts to prevent \nformation of a new Supreme Soviet, raising the prospect of a \nparalysis of government. \n   Box 1 \n                        Regional Variations in Party Activity \n   In Lviv, parties were very active, judging by reports in local \npapers of meetings by Rukh, KUN (Congress of Ukrainian \nNationalists), New Wave, UKRP (Ukrainian Conservative Republican \nParty), and the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party that nominated \ncandidates for Lviv's 23 districts (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4, 12 \nJanuary; Vysokyy Zamok, 4, 6, 18 January).  Although lists of \ncandidates in Lviv papers often did not report the organization \nnominating, a relatively large proportion of candidates were \nidentified as affiliated with a party--in most districts about \nhalf the candidates.  Many of these candidates, however, were \nnominated by groups rather than parties. \n   In Donetsk, which encompasses 47 districts as the most populous \noblast of Ukraine, a high proportion of candidates were \nidentified with parties and parties nominated numerous \ncandidates.  The 19 February Vecherniy Donetsk report on the \nfirst 10 Donetsk districts* identified 51 of the 138 candidates \nwith parties and listed 7 candidates nominated by the CPU \n(Communist Party of Ukraine), 6 by the SPU (Socialist Party of \nUkraine), 6 by the Liberal Party, 4 by the Party of Labor, 3 by \nRukh, 3 by the Party of Justice, 3 by the Peoples Congress of \nDonetsk, and 1 by the URP (Ukrainian Republican Party). \n   In Zaporizhzhya (18 districts) 20 percent of the candidates were \nnominated by parties (18 by Rukh, 18 by the SPU, 12 by the CPU, 7 \nby the Liberal Party, and 4 by the Labor Party), according to the \n8 February Holos Ukrainy. \n   On the other hand, in Kiev Oblast (17 districts) only 12 of the \n264 candidates were nominated by parties (Kiyvska Pravda, 22 \nFebruary)--about 5 percent.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                              Damascus turned the unprecedented visit of an Israeli Arab \ndelegation to Syria into a major media event, eliciting from the \nvisitors strong rhetorical support for Syrian policies. \nPresident Hafiz al-Asad also used the event to restate Syria's \noverall position on the peace process.  The visit itself, and the \nfact that the delegation head was permitted to use Syrian media \nto portray a relatively positive image of the Israeli public and \ngovernment, marks a significant, albeit limited, step in the very \ngradual thawing of Israeli-Syrian ties--a step that Damascus \nprobably hopes will play well in Washington and Israel. \n\n                          END SUMMARY \n\n   Both Damascus and the 57-member delegation of Israeli Arabs \nprofessed that the delegation's 7-10 March visit was for the sole \npurpose of extending condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad on \nthe death of his son Basil in January.  (For example, Jerusalem \nQol Yisra'el, 18 February; Damascus radio, 7 March); nonetheless, \nthe event was also viewed by both sides as having clear political \nsignificance.  For their part, Syria's tightly controlled media \ngave the visit far more extensive coverage than they did a visit \nof a large Druze delegation from the Golan Heights in September \n1992.  Reflecting the political nature of the visit, both \nPresident al-Asad and delegation head 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah- \n-leader of the Arab Democratic Party and Knesset deputy--spoke \nonly briefly about the death of al-Asad's son, focusing instead \nalmost entirely on the Arab-Israel peace process, in televised \nspeeches (Damascus Television, 9 March). \n\n   A Show of Support for Syria \n\n   Syria orchestrated the visit as a show of support for its own \npolicies, from the peace process, to the PLO, to Syrian Jews. \nDamascus elicited the visitors' vocal support via the Syrian \nmedia, which carried numerous statements by Darawshah extolling \nSyria and scoring Israeli policies.  For example: \n\n   -- According to Damascus radio, Darawshah called the destruction \nof Qunaytirah1--which the delegation visited on its second day in \nSyria--\"a deplorable crime\" and \"praised the heroic struggle of \nthe Syrian Armed Forces supported by the heroic Syrian people in \ndefense of Arab territory\" (8 March).  In his address to al-Asad, \nhe asserted that \"we share the same position with you\" on the \npeace process. \n\n   -- Damascus radio quoted Darawshah as saying that the purpose of \nhis delegation's visit with Syrian Jews was \"to clarify some \nIsraeli political and public opinion issues\" and \"prove to all \nwho seek to distort the truth that Syria does not discriminate \nagainst the Musawi community\" [community of the followers of \nMoses]. \n\n   -- In an interview with Damascus radio, Darawshah said the \ndelegation had found that in Syria \"everything is abundant, \nfreedom is available, and loftiness and dignity characterize \nevery action by Syria, led by President Hafiz al-Asad, may God \npreserve him\" (9 March). \n\n   -- Delegation member and Knesset deputy Talib al-Sani' was even \nquoted as scoring Israel for trying to \"penetrate the Arab world \neconomically and to propagate the idea of a Middle East market\" \n(Damascus radio, 10 March)--a recurrent theme in Syrian media in \nrecent months (for example, a Tishrin editorial, as reported by \nDamascus radio on 8 February). \n\n   Even Syria's choice of personalities to greet the delegation on \narrival at the airport was clearly meant as a statement: Khalid \nal-Fahum, head of a Syrian-backed umbrella group of Palestinian \nrejectionists opposed to the PLO, was the only figure reported to \naccompany the governor of Damascus to the airport (Damascus \nradio, 7 March).  The Syrians thus created the appearance of an \naffinity between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians supported by \nDamascus, while giving the PLO--still scorned by the Syrians \nbecause of the 13 September Israeli-PLO declaration of \nPrinciples--a symbolic jab. \n\n   1Qunaytirah was captured by Israel in 1967 and returned to Syria \nin ruins following the conclusion of a disengagement of forces \nagreement in 1974. \n\n   Al-Asad Uses Visit for Peace Message \n\n   While the visitors were used as channels for extolling Syrian \npolicies, the visit also afforded Damascus an opportunity to send \nsome signals on the peace process for foreign--particularly U.S. \nand Israeli--consumption.  Al-Asad used his meeting with the \ndelegation as a platform for his first policy statement since the \ndeath of his son.  While breaking no new ground, al-Asad stressed \nSyria's commitment to peace, at times echoing his now famous \n\"peace of the brave\" speech to the 1992 Druze delegation \n(Damascus radio, 9 September 1992).  He told the Israeli Arabs: \n\"We seriously seek peace, and the Israeli officials know this,\" \nadding, \"In light of what they [Israel] are proposing, it seems \nthat their vision of peace is not the same as ours.  Therefore, \nwe will struggle until their peace becomes identical with our \npeace . . . . Peace means rights.  In other words, each party has \nits rights and each party is the master of itself and its \ninterests . . . . When we said the peace of the brave, we meant \nthat each party will achieve full peace with all its rights, and \nthat neither party will humiliate the other.\" \n\n   A Limited Opening to Israel \n\n   The visit itself marked a symbolic though limited advance in \nSyrian willingness to take small steps toward opening contacts \nwith Israel.  It follows such modest advances as an evidently \nofficially sanctioned series of meetings outside the Middle East \nbetween Syrian and Israeli academics reported by Israeli and \ninternational media (for example, Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el, 31 \nDecember 1993; Yedi'ot Aharonot, 2 January 1994), and the 1992 \nvisit by the Druze delegation, which crossed into Syria directly \nfrom the Golan Heights and--according to Israeli Prime Minister \nYitzhaq Rabin--included some Israeli passport holders (Jerusalem \nQol Yisra'el, 1 September 1992; Tel Aviv Bamahane, 23 September \n1992, respectively).  The fact that Darawshah and al-Sani' are \nnot only Israeli citizens but also members of Knesset made the \nsymbolism of the visit still more salient.  In addition, coverage \nof the visit for Israel radio by Israeli Arab correspondents who \nfiled a series of live dispatches from Damascus was another \nunprecedented event. \n\n   Damascus took pains to prevent the visit from appearing as a \nprecedent for normalization with Israel but nonetheless allowed \nthe visit's symbolism to be clearly conveyed to the Syrian \npublic.  On the one hand, delegation members were forced to \ntravel to Syria via Cairo rather than directly from Israel and \nwere barred from using Israeli passports (Cairo MENA, 7 March, \nQol Yisra'el, 1O March).  In addition, Syrian media--and even \nthe delegation members--avoided any explicit reference to the \ngroup's citizenship, referring to the visitors repeatedly as \n\"1948 Palestinians.\"  On the other hand, the political status of \nthe delegation members was made perfectly clear on Syrian media. \nFor example, Darawshah was quoted by the official Syrian news \nservice SANA as saying on arrival in Damascus:  \"We represent the \nPalestinians in the Galilee, in the Negev, and other cities\" (7 \nMarch).   Moreover, Syrian media's airing of remarks by Darawshah \neven made it clear that he is a Knesset member.  For example, \nafter calling in a Damascus television interview for Israeli \nwithdrawal from all the occupied territories, Darawshah declared: \n\"We say this from Damascus, and we also say the same thing in the \nKnesset in Jerusalem.\" \n\n   The visit also brought somewhat greater openness in Syrian \nmedia's treatment of Israel, as Darawshah was permitted to use \nSyrian television to convey an unusually detailed and relatively \nsympathetic portrayal of the Israeli government, the internal \nIsraeli political situation, and Israeli public opinion.  After \ncalling in his televised address for an Israeli commitment to \nwithdraw from the occupied territories, Darawshah asserted that \n\"of late, many people in Israel have begun to express stands \nsupportive of this formula\" and that their numbers are \n\"increasing.\"  In his 1O March television interview, Darawshah \ndepicted the government as interested in making further \nconcessions but constrained by domestic political factors.  He \nnoted that the current Israeli coalition government \"is supported \nby the Arab parties\" and that an expanded coalition \"would enable \nthe government to continue the peace process and to make \nconcessions that will respond to the true Arab demands.\"  He also \ndescribed what he said was \"a rational trend\" in Israel that is \n\"strong indeed\" and which believes that \"we must end occupation.\" \nHe observed that \"the demonstrations staged by tens of thousands \nof people\" in the wake of the Hebron massacre \"was a joint \ndemonstration by the Arab and Jewish pro-peace forces,\" adding \nthat \"we participated in it.\" \n\n   Although the Syrian television host openly took issue with some \nof Darawshah's remarks--such as the notion that there are doves \nin Israel--the visitor's overall message was evidently agreed on \nin advance, as suggested by the manner in which the interviewer \nappeared to pave the way for Darawshah's comments.  For example, \nhe asked Darawshah, \"What is new in Zionist thought and \ndirection?\" \n\n   Further Visits? \n\n   The delegation's visit has prompted reports in Israeli media that \nthere will be future visits to Syria by other Israeli citizens, \nbut there have been no such reports in Syrian media.  Evidently \nbased on comments by an Israeli Arab journalist who was part of \nthe delegation, Qol Yisra'el reported that Foreign Minister Faruq \nal-Shar' had told the group the delegation's visit \"is an opening \nfor additional visits to Syria by Israelis\" (11 March).  Ool \nYisra'el reported the same day that a delegation led by Ibrahim \nNimr Husayn, chairman of Israel's National Committee of Arab \nLocal Councils, and Ahmad al-Tibi, an Israeli citizen and adviser \nto PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat--\"may soon leave for Syria.\"  Another \nQol Yisra'el report claimed that a 170-member delegation of Golan \nDruze was being permitted by Israel to visit Damascus to extend \ncondolences to al-Asad on his son's death, but that the Syrians \nhad not yet approved the visit (15 March). \n\n   Implications \n\n   The very fact that Darawshah was given a forum for his more \nfavorable statements on Israel suggests that Syria wants the \nvisit to be seen as a significant indication of a genuine Syrian \nopenness to peace with Israel and as meeting Israeli demands that \nsuch openness be conveyed more clearly to the Syrian public.  Now \nthat the barrier to visits by Israeli Arabs has been lifted, \nthere may well be more such visits.  But, considering Syrian \nsensitivity over even the appearance of normalizing relations \nwith the Jewish state, and given Syria's repeated objections to \nIsraeli demands for a commitment to such normalization in the \nfuture, similar visits by Jewish citizens of Israel are probably \nnot imminent. \n   (AUTHOR:  BROWN.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n                                        The Japanese Government appears to be making only slow progress \non the package of measures it is drawing up to demonstrate to the \nUnited States that it is willing to open Japanese markets and \nderegulate the Japanese economy.  This slowness is apparently due \nin part to divisions within the government over prospective parts \nof the package, such as increases in long-term investment and tax \ncuts.  Infighting within the coalition government and a growing \nperception that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government is \nineffective also appear to be slowing progress on the market \nopening package. \n                                     END SUMMARY \n   Japanese Government leaders continue to send signals that \nprogress on the package of market opening measures that Tokyo is \ndrawing up is proceeding slowly and will not be completed by the \noriginally projected date at the end of March.   According to the \n16 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi \nTakemura told a news conference on 15 March that a final package \nof measures would not be presented to the United States until the \nG-7 Summit in July.  Although earlier reporting indicated that an \ninterim package might be ready by the end of March, the 16 March \nNihon Keizai Shimbun report did not quote Takemura as saying \nanything about such a package.  Similarly, the 16 March Mainichi \nShimbun quoted Minister of International Trade and Industry \nHiroshi Kumagai as telling reporters on 15 March that it would be \n\"impossible\" to complete measures designed to deregulate the \nJapanese economy by the end of March.  Kumagai reportedly added \nthat it would \"probably take until the end of June to resolve\" \nissues connected with the measures. \n   One of the factors delaying progress on the package appears to be \nthat the government is divided over several of the most important \nmeasures in the package.  One of these measures is reportedly a \nplan to increase investment under Japan's current 10-year plan \nfor investment in public works projects by about 100 trillion yen \nover the current 430 trillion yen.  This plan appears to have \nsupport from several cabinet ministers, including Director \nGeneral of the Economic Planning Agency Manae Kubota, \nConstruction Minister Kozo Igarashi, and Transport Minister \nShigeru Ito, all of whom belong to the Social Democratic Party of \nJapan (SDPJ), the largest party in the ruling coalition. \nAccording to a 4 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun report, Kubota came \nout in favor of increasing the investment plan during a 4 March \nnews conference, arguing that the increase would help jump start \nthe sagging Japanese economy.  A 4 March Kyodo report indicated \nthat Igarashi supported Kubota and advocated increasing \ninvestment to 600 trillion yen.  The 10 March Yomiuri Shimbun \nidentified Ito as another supporter of the plan.  In addition, \nJapan's two leading business groups, the Federation of Economic \nOrganizations (Keidanren) and the Japan Association of Corporate \nExecutives (Keizai Doyukai) have also supported the increase, \naccording to 7 March Kyodo and 8 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun \nreports. \n   The Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, reportedly opposes the \nincrease because there are no clear sources of revenue to finance \nit.  The 1O March Yomiuri Shimbun quoted Minister of Finance \nHirohisa Fujii, a member of the Shinseito, a key party in the \nruling coalition, as telling a 9 March news conference that \ndiscussions of the increase, \"including financial resources, are \njust beginning and there is no need to change our pace.\"  The \npaper also cited an unnamed MOF official as stating that \"it \nwould be irresponsible to make a pledge to expand investment when \nthere is no hope of securing financial resources.\"  According to \nYomiuri Shimbun, MOF is particularly concerned about increasing \ninvestment in public works when reform of the tax system is still \nunder debate.  In addition, the paper reported that unnamed \nofficials in MOF are arguing that there was no need to include an \nincrease in the 1O-year investment plan in the measures the \ngovernment is currently drawing up in the wake of the collapse of \nU.S.-Japan trade talks because the United States \"has not once \nasked for expansion of public investment during the framework \ntalks.\" \n   Tax Reform \n   Another contentious issue among the market opening measures is \ntax reform, particularly the timing and scope of proposed tax \ncuts.  Some ministries and some bureaucrats, including some \nofficials in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry \n(MITI), appear to be pressing the coalition to decide quickly on \na tax reform package to include in the package of market opening \nmeasures.  An unnamed senior MITI official told an Asahi Shimbun \nreporter on 10 March that the ruling coalition should make a \n\"quick decision\" about tax system reform and include tax reform \nplans in the market opening measures (Asahi Shimbun, 11 March). \nSpeaking at a news conference several days later, MITI Minister \nHiroshi Kumagai also reportedly pressed for a rapid decision on \ntax cuts, stating that the government must come up with a plan by \nthe end of June.  The SDPJ has also been widely reported to be a \nstrong supporter of tax cuts. \n   Here too, however, the MOF appears to be blocking progress.  The \nministry apparently continues to oppose any measures to cut taxes \nunless sources of revenue other than deficit financing bonds can \nbe identified to offset the cuts.  During a news conference on 11 \nMarch, Finance Minister Fujii argued that the Japanese Government \nshould not make hasty decisions about tax reform or tax cuts only \nin order to include them in the package of measures designed to \naddress U.S.-Japan trade friction, according to an 11 March Kyodo \nreport. \n   Bureaucratic Resistance \n   Resistance from elsewhere within the government bureaucracy may \nalso be stalling work on some of the market opening measures, \nparticularly those designed to deregulate the Japanese economy. \nThe 10 March Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed officials in the \nCabinet Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs, which is \nreportedly charged with compiling deregulation measures, as \ncomplaining that the ministries were \"reluctant\" to draw up any \nmeasures beyond those that they have already presented to the \nHosokawa administration.  Similarly, according to the 10 March \nYomiuri Shimbun, many government ministries and agencies are \narguing that they have already implemented as many measures to \nderegulate their operations as they are currently capable of \ndoing. \n   Coalition Infighting \n   A fourth factor delaying progress on the market opening package \nappears to be infighting within the ruling coalition government \nover the handling of the package.  In particular, tensions \nbetween Prime Minister Hosokawa and Shinseito Secretary General \nIchiro Ozawa on the one hand and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura \non the other seem to be spilling over into the handling of the \nmarket opening package.  According to the 10 March Asahi Shimbun, \nTakemura was charged with overseeing work on the market opening \npackage.  However, because of the tension between Hosokawa and \nTakemura, some government offices seem to have been reluctant to \nwork with the Chief Cabinet Secretary.  The 10 March Asahi \nShimbun reported that some ministry officials question whether he \nhas Hosokawa's confidence. \n   Tensions between Ozawa and Takemura and also between the \ncoalition and the bureaucracy may have derailed Ozawa's planned \ntrip to Washington at the end of March to discuss market opening \nmeasures.  According to the 16 March Yomiuri Shimbun, both Ozawa \nand Takemura appear to have been working from different \ndirections to resolve bilateral trade frictions, and Takemura may \nhave seen Ozawa's trip as as undercutting Takemura's official \nrole in coordinating work on the market opening package.  In \naddition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appears to have \nresented Ozawa's plans to get involved in bilateral relations. \nThe 13 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted MOFA and Japanese \nEmbassy officials as claiming they never heard of plans for \nOzawa's trip and denying that it had been approved by the \nJapanese Government.  According to the 16 March Nihon Keizai \nShimbun, MOFA officials were miffed that they were not consulted \nabout the trip. \n   Outlook \n   The divisions within the government, the resistance of parts of \nthe bureaucracy, and infighting within the coalition will \nprobably not only continue to delay progress on the market \nopening measures, but also to limit the scope of any measures \nthat are ultimately drawn up.  Some of the steps being debated, \nsuch as tax reform, involve deep, long-standing divisions among \nthe parties in the ruling coalition that will probably be very \ndifficult to resolve in the near future.  In order to incorporate \nsuch steps in the market opening package without threatening the \nunity of the already splintering coalition, the coalition parties \nwill probably have to work out compromises that will water down \nthe measures to the point that they will have relatively little \nimpact. \n(AUTHOR:  BOUNDS.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n                             A lengthy statement attributed to the imprisoned Shining Path \nleadership, published recently in a leading opposition newspaper, \nprovides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace \nproposal made by the insurgents last fall.  While the newspaper \nhas accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the \nShining Path, the paper has also stressed that the peace called \nfor in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical \nretreat by the Shining Path leaders and is not, as President \nAlberto Fujimori has contended, an implicit admission of defeat. \n                         END SUMMARY \n   Although La Republica, a prominent anti-Fujimori daily, provided \nlittle information on the origins of the \"important and unusual\" \ndocument that it published in a special 25 January supplement, it \nassured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining \nthe Shining Path's \"struggle for a peace agreement\" was a genuine \nShining Path statement.  The paper claimed that the \"anonymous \nsources\" who supplied the \"secret\" document provided \"full \nauthentication\" and that \"experts\" consulted by the paper also \n\"agreed\" that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned \nShining Path leader Abimael Guzman (La Republica, 26 \nJanuary).(See Note 1) \n   (Note 1) La Republica did not assert that the document was \nactually signed by Guzman.  However, the paper did claim that the \ndocument was \"approved\" by imprisoned Shining Path Central \nCommittee members Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, Osman Morote \nBarrionuevo, Marta Huatay Ruiz, Maria Pantoja Sanchez and Rosa \nAngelica Salas de la Cruz (25 January). \n   While the anti-Fujimori daily may have, at least in part, \npublished the document to discredit President Fujimori, it \ncontended that it was motivated by a desire to provide Peruvians \nwith information on the peace proposal that had not been made \navailable by the government.  The paper declared that it was \n\"clearly\" its \"duty\" to publish the document \"given the mantle of \nsilence that the government has cast\" over the peace negotiations \n(26 January). \n   La Republica's publication of the Shining Path strategy statement \nfollows by three months the October 1993 release by the Fujimori \ngovernment of letters from Guzman calling for peace talks with \nthe government (Radio Programs del Peru, 1 October 1993; Radio \nand TV, 4 October 1993; Global de Television, 10 October 1993; \nPanamericana Television, 30 October 1993).  The Shining Path \nleadership's sudden willingness to pursue peace talks with the \ngovernment, just as the 31 October national referendum vote was \napproaching, raised questions in the media about whether the \nletters really represented authoritative Shining Path policy [see \nbox].(See Note 2) \n   (Note 2) Among other objectives, the narrowly successful \nreferendum was designed to allow the president to serve a second \nsuccessive term. \n   Tactical Retreat for Guzman \n   Implicitly rejecting Fujimori's claim that the Shining Path's \ncall for a negotiated peace represented an admission of political \ndefeat by the insurgents, La Republica concluded that the \nmovement's leadership saw its call for peace as nothing more than \na \"temporary ceasefire\" (25 January).(See Note 3)  According to \nthe daily's 26 January editorial, the Shining Path tract \"makes \nit clear\" that in the eyes of Abimael Guzman a \"peace agreement\" \nis simply an \"armed truce\" until after the year 2OOO, at which \ntime the Shining Path \"would resume its bloodbath.\"  La Republica \noffered a possible explanation for the insurgents' tactical \nretreat in a 3O January interview with a \"military and subversion \nanalyst,\" who suggested-that a temporary withdrawal may offer \nGuzman an opportunity to preserve his authority as political \nleader despite the obvious limitations of beings imprisoned.  Thee \nanalyst concluded, therefore, that the insurgents' peace strategy \nrepresents \"an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman's leadership\" \nand \"recognition that circumstances have changed.\" \n   (Note 3) For example, in his presentation of the video recording \nof Guzman's first call for peace talks, Fujimori claimed that the \nShining Path \"political\" leadership \"has tacitly admitted that \nthe Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in \nconfronting the Shining Path\" (Lima Radio and TV, 4 October \n1993). \n   Outlook \n   La Republica's assessment of the Shining Path peace strategy \ndocument may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling \nfor peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders. \nAt the same time, however, by concluding that the published \nstrategy statement is merely the Shining Path's declaration of \ntemporary retreat, the daily has raised new questions about the \ncredibility of Fujimori's claim that the call for peace \nrepresents a victory for the government.  While such doubts are \nunlikely to seriously affect Fujimori's prospects for reelection \nnext year, they may have further tarnished the image of the \nPeruvian president, already damaged by his narrow victory in the \nconstitutional referendum last October. \n   BOX \n   Media Doubts over Earlier Shining Path Peace Letters \n   -- Following the first Guzman letter calling for peace talks, \nannounced by Fujimori at thee United Nations last October (Radio \nProgramas del Peru, 1 October 1993), the conservative daily El \nComercio reported that one seasoned political observer had \nwarned\" that Guzman's \"reported\" desire \"to reach a peace \nagreement\" does not mean there is reason \"to claim a victory in \nthe ongoing struggle against terrorism\" since, according to the \nobserver, the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control \nthe Shining Path (2 October 1993). \n   -- Following the second Guzman letter, which supplemented the \ncall for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for Fujimori's \neconomic and political program (Lima Global de Television, 1O \nOctober 1993), a commentator for the anti-Fujimori weekly Caretas \nwrote that the government was using a \"broken\" Guzman \"in the \ncampaign for the 'yes' vote\" for the upcoming referendum, adding \nthat \"it is no coincidence that the letters . . . have come out \nduring the 3O days prior\" to the 31 October vote (14 October \n1993). \n   -- Responding similarly to the second Guzman letter, an editorial \nin La Republica wondered whether \"government representatives,\" \nworking to promote the \"yes\" vote on the referendum, had not \n\"fallen into a trap\" by thinking that Shining Path militants \nwould take seriously such an \"unctuous\" call for peace talks as \nappeared in the letter (14 October 1993). \n   -- Also in response to the second letter, Caretas on 14 October \nclaimed that Fujimori was \"using\" Guzman \"in the campaign\" to win \nthe 31 October referendum, noting that \"with Guzman's letters\" \ncalling for peace talks, Fujimori's \"promise\" to wipe out the \nShining Path by 1995 \"may gain credibility.\" \n   END BOX \n(AUTHOR:  ROLLINS.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n                                        Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hailed the results of his \nmeeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher as \nindicating that the U.S.-Russian partnership is able to surmount \nrecent strains and continue to develop.  Kozyrev's reaction \ncontrasted with his recent statements on the bilateral \nrelationship in which he suggested that Russia was being \nrelegated to a subordinate role ill-suited to its capabilities \nand national interests. \n                                     END SUMMARY \n   Kozyrev gave an upbeat assessment of the state of U.S.-Russian \nrelations following his 14 March meeting with Secretary \nChristopher in Vladivostok.  He expressed satisfaction with the \nresults of the meeting, emphasizing that the two countries acted \nas equals during discussions on a broad range of international \nissues.  Dismissing the recent strains in the relationship, \nKozyrev asserted that \"we are partners and we will continue to \nwork in this direction\" (ITAR-TASS, 14 March).  He told reporters \nthat \"circles\" in both Russia and the United States object to the \n\"mature and strategic nature\" of the bilateral relationship and \nthat \"all sorts of hiccups and problems,\" like ex-President \nRichard Nixon's protocol difficulties or \"spy fever,\" are bound \nto occur, \"but we are too serious to give into them\" (Interfax, \n14 March). \n   Previous Concerns \n   Prior to the meeting, Kozyrev had expressed concerns about the \nstate of U.S.-Russian relations and suggested that adjustments to \nthe partnership needed to be made: \n   -- On the eve of his departure from Moscow for Vladivostok, he \ntold reporters that the aim of the meeting would be to develop \nthe partnership on a \"new basis,\" stressing that there could be \nno question of a \"junior\" or\"senior\" partner, or \"more freedom \nfor one to the detriment of the other.\"  Rejecting suggestions \nthat relations had begun to cool, he noted that there can be \n\"differing interests\" within the partnership (Moscow radio, 14 \nMarch). \n   -- Similarly, in a 10 March television interview he said that he \nand Christopher would discuss what form of partnership the two \ncountries should have, stressing that \"we should agree on this so \nit does not cause annoyance\" or \"come as a surprise when Russia \ncomes out with its own initiative.\"  Noting that Russia feels \n\"offended\" when U.S. officials launch an initiative that the two \ncountries should have agreed upon together, Kozyrev said that \nsuch differences needed to be \"clarified\" and a \"mechanism for \ninteraction\" should be \"finalized\" (Moscow TV, 10 March). \n   -- In an article on U.S.-Russian relations published in Izvestiya \non 11 March, he also called for adjustments in the relationship, \nwhile at the same time stressing that \"there is no reasonable \nalternative to partnership,\" which he implied is essential to \nshape a democratic Russia and \"transform the unstable post- \ncommunist world into a lasting democratic one.\"  He claimed that \nRussian and U.S. national interests concerning \"the main world \nproblems\" not only \"do not conflict\" but \"complement each other.\" \nHe stressed, however, that \"certain illusions\" such as a Western \nview that \"if the Russians are good they must follow us in \neverything,\" or a Russian view that partnership \"is an idyllic \nsituation without conflicts and problems\" must be abandoned.  He \ncontended that partnership \"based on common values and \nsympathies\" does not mean renouncing \"competition and disputes\" \nor \"a firm or aggressive policy of upholding your own national \ninterests.\"  He cautioned, moreover, that agreeing to play a \nsubordinate role would be as \"unwarranted as it is politically \ndangerous\" for Russia in view of the \"extreme nationalist and \nreactionary [domesticj forces\" who would \"immediately take \nadvantage\" of such a stance.  Warning that exponents \"of gloomy \nself-fulfilling prophecies\" would exploit U.S.-Russian disputes \nif they continue, he called upon the two countries to develop a \nstrategy and instruments for partnership, and particularly a \nmechanism \"for coordinating their actions\" on international \nproblems. \n   Media Concerns About Relationship \n   Russia media commentary on the Vladivostok meeting has so far \nbeen sparse, but its thrust has been to dismiss the upbeat \nofficial assessments of the meeting and continue to focus on \nproblems facing the relationship.  A 15 March commentary in the \nreformist newspaper Kommersant-Daily dismissed the official line \nthat the meeting \"plastered over the cracks\" in the relationship, \nasserting that despite \"the upbeat tone of the joint statement,\" \n\"more cracks may develop soon.\"  Commenting on Russia's new \ninvolvement in the Middle East, the article noted that U.S. \nactions in the region were \"emphatically independent from Moscow\" \nand warned that \"there is an obvious rivalry in Middle East \npeacemaking between Moscow and Washington.\"  In a 16 March \narticle in the reformist newspaper Segodnya, a commentator, \nchiding the \"incompetence\" of both U.S. and Russian officials, \ncontended that the Russian Foreign Ministry, by displaying the \n\"most intense activity possible,\" had created a \"legend\" about \n\"stunning foreign policy successes\" that could trigger U.S. ideas \nabout \"containment.\"  The commentator said that Washington \nappeared \"ready to go to any lengths\" to prevent a return to a \n\"global nuclear standoff,\" but warned that the \"stabilization in \nbilateral relations\" proclaimed at Vladivostok \"may be \nshortlived.\" \n   Before the meeting, Russian media commentators had speculated \nabout whether or how badly U.S.-Russian relations had been \ndamaged in the wake of controversy over Bosnia, the Ames spy \ncase, the Nixon visit, and other differences.  Some commentators, \nechoing Kozyrev, tried to minimize any coolness or weakening in \nthe partnership while others, ignoring the Vladivostok meeting, \ncontended that the United States had already changed its policy \ntoward Russia: \n   -- Echoing the government line, Moscow radio commentaries on 12 \nMarch played down any differences.  Commentator Yuriy Solton said \nSecretary Christopher had refuted reports that Washington was \ndissatisfied with Moscow's active policy in Yugoslavia, noting \nthat he had said the United States welcomed Russia's initiatives, \nin Bosnia and elsewhere.  Solton stressed that statements that \nU.S.-Russian relations had become \"more strained\" or \"in poor \ncondition\" were \"absolutely groundless.\"  Admitting that each \ncountry \"wants to pursue its own end,\" Solton emphasized that \nMoscow and Washington were doing this \"in close cooperation with \neach other\" and without any of the \"rivalry\" of the Cold War. \nContending that both Moscow and Washington saw their main task as \nconsistently improving their relationship, Solton said this task \nwould \"define\" the atmosphere at Vladivostok.  Likewise, \ncommentator Valentin Zorin, dismissing the recent disputes as \noccurring in a period marked by \"the loss of illusions\" on both \nsides, stressed that \"global confrontation\" between the two \ncountries is \"a thing of the past\" and that \"what unites them is \nso much more important that frictions that may emerge.\" \n   -- In contrast, a 5 March article in the mass-circulation \nnewspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda took issue with Secretary \nChristopher's reported statement that Russia could not act \nunilaterally in responding to appeals for military assistance \nfrom countries of the former Soviet Union, but could only respond \nunder the auspices of the United Nations or other international \norganizations.  The article also alleged that the Secretary had \ncommented on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 24 February \nspeech, which had spoken of Russia's right to act to ensure \nstability and protect Russians in the near abroad, \"with some \nscorn.\"  Contending that the warnings from Washington were an \nattempt to keep Russia in the inferior state to which it had been \nreduced in recent years, often by the \"shortsightedness of \n[Russian] diplomats,\" and to \"guarantee\" Washington's \n\"superpowerdom,\" the article advised Kozyrev to have a \"serious \ntalk\" about this with Secretary Christopher in Vladivostok. \n   -- A 12 March article by prominent foreign affairs commentator \nAleksandr Golts in the Defense Ministry's newspaper, Krasnaya \nZvezda, titled \"The Chill Must Not Develop Into Confrontation,\" \nwarned that \"conflicts and microcrises\" in U.S.-Russian relations \nhad been following each other \"virtually without interruption and \nin ever-increasing intensity.\"  Criticizing Washington for, among \nother things, intensifying U.S. involvement in CIS affairs in \norder to prevent the revival of a dreaded Russian \"empire,\" Golts \ncharged that such an approach not only was inappropriate for \nstates \"that only yesterday were calling themselves allies,\" but \nwent \"beyond the bounds of common sense\" and could scuttle \nefforts to settle conflicts.  Taking issue-with Secretary \nChristopher's remarks on Russian peacekeeping efforts, Golts \nasked with evident sarcasm if the United States allowed its own \nfreedom of action to be restricted \"anywhere at all\" by \nconsultations with international organizations.  Golts contended \nthat Russia's active involvement in trying to end conflicts both \nin the former Soviet republics and elsewhere was important not \nonly because Moscow was \"offering sensible ways to end the \nsuffering of thousands,\" but also because it strengthened \nRussia's self-esteem by demonstrating that Russia was a state \nthat could resolve global problems.  While asserting that US.- \nRussian differences were \"not insoluble,\" Golts warned that \nneither Russia nor the United States can afford the \"luxury of a \nnew confrontation\" while they search for a new model of mutual \nrelations, and he called upon both states to use the Vladivostok \nmeeting to \"prevent undesirable developments.\" \n   -- A 12 March article in the pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya \nheadlined that U.S.-Russian relations are experiencing \"the most \nserious crisis of recent years.\"  In describing the reasons for \nthe \"time of coolness,\" the article supported Moscow's \"proper\" \nresponse to the Nixon visit and diplomatic activism in the \nBalkans, the Middle East, and the \"near abroad,\" but fretted over \nhow Washington might react to such policy \"changes.\"  For \nexample, the article cited a \"Western diplomat\" as complaining \nthat after the reformers' poor showing in the December \nparliamentary elections, the Yeltsin administration adopted the \n\"slogans of the opposition,\" adding it was difficult to know who \nwas making foreign policy pronouncements--Kozyrev or Communist \nleader Gennadiy Zyuganov.  Ending on an optimistic note, the \narticle reported that the Russian Foreign Ministry would \"strive \nto avoid confrontation with Washington\" at Vladivostok and quoted \nan \"informed\" ministry source as saying \"there are no major \nreasons for exacerbating\" U.S.-Russian relations. \n   -- Ignoring the upcoming meeting entirely in a 12 March article \nin procommunist newspaper Pravda, commentator Vladislav Drobkov \nreported on what he called \"Washington's change of direction\" and \n\"campaign\" to reevalute relations with Russia and develop ties \nwith other countries of the former Soviet Union.  Claiming that \nall his Washington interlocutors had \"invariably\" said that \n\"coolness\" had set in between Moscow and Washington, Drobkov \nbacked up his argument by quoting alleged statements about Russia \nby U.S. officials.  For example, he quoted Senator Richard Lugar \nas saying \"[The United States] is not Russia's partner, we are \nbitter rivals.\" \n   Implications \n   Kozyrev's efforts to play down any substantive differences with \nWashington probably reflect Moscow's determination to keep \nbilateral relations on track, but his emphasis on achieving \nequality in the relationship indicates an equally strong \ndetermination that Russia not be relegated to what Russians would \nview as an inferior role.  The media's continuing preoccupation \nwith the differences and disputes between Washington and Moscow \nsuggests an ongoing tension between pride that Russia is resuming \nwhat is perceived as its rightful role as a global power and \nconcern that a confrontation with Washington might revive a Cold \nWar-like climate. \n(AUTHOR:  BELLINGER.

Tokyo's divergent \ninterpretation may reflect an attempt to keep the agreement from \nserving as a precedent for Tokyo's acceptance of targets for \nmeasuring its trade performance in other sectors. \n                                     END SUMMARY \n   In comments to the Japanese press, a number of Japanese \nGovernment officials have taken issue with reported statements by \nvarious U.S. officials on the 12 March cellular telephone \nagreement.  These differences with U.S. officials' \ninterpretations focus on language that commits the Japanese \nGovernment to ensuring that the Japanese telecommunications \ncompany Nippon Idou Tsushin (IDO) carries out its pledges to \nincrease market access for the U.S. firm Motorola. \n   -- According to the 14 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, when the \nagreement was announced on 12 March, Vice Minister of Posts and \nTelecommunications Takenori Kanzaki specifically denied that the \nJapanese Government had accepted any sort of numerical targets. \n   --  The 14 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun also reported that Ministry \nof Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) General Affairs Councillor \nMasahito Tani on 13 March took issue with comments reportedly \nmade by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that the \nagreement represented a victory for the U.S. Government's \nresults-oriented policy in dealing with U.S.-Japan trade issues. \nTani reportedly said that in the Japanese Government's view, \nIDO's commitment to increase the number of base stations capable \nof handling Motorola equipment was \"neither a numerical target \nnor an objective criterion.  It is nothing but a private \ncorporation's contract.\" \n   -- According to the 15 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Vice Minister \nof Foreign Affairs Kunihiko Saito attempted to play down a clause \nin the agreement between the U.S. and Japanese Governments which \nstates that Tokyo will use \"all available measures\" to ensure \nthat IDO fulfills the agreement.  The paper quoted Saito as \nstating that \"All this means is something like conducting regular \nchecks on the degree of progress being made in dealings between \nthe private companies.\"  Saito also reportedly told Kyodo on 14 \nMarch that the Japanese Government was in no position to \nintervene in the affairs of private companies and asserted that \nany difference in the U.S. and Japanese interpretation of the \nagreement was because of Washington's misunderstanding of the \naccord. \n   -- Similarly, Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications \nFutoshi Shirai, in comments to Kyodo on 14 March, took issue with \nreported remarks by U.S. officials, stating that the Japanese \nGovernment had in no way agreed to guarantee that IDO would meet \nthe target of building 159 base stations using Motorola \ntechnology as stipulated in the cellular phone agreement. \n   -- An unidentified senior Ministry of International Trade and \nIndustry MITI) official reportedly told Kyodo on 15 March that \nthe Japanese Government had provided no guarantee that IDO would \nfulfill its commitments. \n   Concern Over Precedent \n   One of the major reasons for the Japanese Government's efforts to \nlimit the way in which the cellular phone agreement is \ninterpreted appears to be a concern that the United States will \nattempt to use the agreement as a model for setting numerical \ntargets for market opening measures in other sectors.  A 15 March \nKyodo report quoted an unidentified senior MITI official as \nstating that Japan could not accept any interpretation of the \nagreement that would lead to the setting of numerical targets. \nAccording to the 15 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, MITI is \nparticularly worried that the United States might try to use the \nmodel of the cellular telephone agreement in the auto sector, \nasking Japanese Government to provide guarantees for voluntary \ntargets for imports of U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts that \nJapanese automobile companies are reportedly currently drawing \nup.  In a 16 March speech, MITI Vice Minister for International \nAffairs Sozaburo Okamatsu reportedly specifically stated that the \ncellular telephone agreement could not be applied to the \nautomobile sector.  According to a 16 March Kyodo report, \nOkamatsu stated that while the telecommunications sector was \nregulated by government licenses, the auto and auto parts \nindustries were \"completely free trade areas\" which could not be \ncontrolled by the government. \n   The cancellation of a planned visit to Washington by Ichiro \nOzawa, Secretary General of one of the key parties in the ruling \ncoalition and the Japanese politician widely reported to have \nbeen instrumental in framing the cellular phone accord may also \nreflect the Japanese Government's desire to limit the impact of \nthe cellular phone agreement.  The 16 March Yomiuri Shimbun \nquoted senior members of Ozawa's party and other Japanese \nofficials as stating that the United States pinned too high hopes \non Ozawa, expecting that he would come to Washington with \"a bag \npacked with a lot of gifts.\" \n   Outlook \n   Japanese officials will probably do everything possible to keep \nthe cellular telephone pact from serving as a precedent for the \nsetting of numerical targets in other sectors.  The difference in \ninterpretation with the United States, however, has the potential \nto create further friction in bilateral relations.  In the past, \nTokyo has differed with the United States over the wording of \nsuch agreements as the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement \nand the agreement setting up the U.S.-Japan framework talks \nreached by former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and President \nClinton in July, 1993.  In the semiconductor agreement, Tokyo has \nconsistently argued that the United States has misinterpreted a \npledge that the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor \nmarket would reach 20 percent by the fourth quarter of 1992 as a \nformal commitment, when the Japanese government intended it only \nas a goal.  Similarly, in the framework agreement, the Japanese \ngovernment has consistently disagreed with the United States over \nhow to define the \"objective criteria\" which the agreement stated \nwould be established to measure Japan's trade performance. \n(AUTHOR:  BOUNDS.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n                                        Reflecting concern within the European Union (EU) that the U.S. \nrevival of the Super 301 trade law provision could eventually \nhave a negative effect on Europe and that U.S. bilateral deals \nwith Japan could hurt European business, EU leaders reacted \nsharply to the U.S. move and its threat of sanctions against \nJapan.  Apparently anxious not to be left out of any deals, \nhowever, EU leaders, as well as French and German officials, have \ntempered their criticism and urged a \"trilateral\" U.S.-EU- \nJapanese approach to efforts to remove barriers in Japan.  French \nand German media likewise criticized U.S. trade policy measures \nbut have revealed a strong current of sympathy for U.S. efforts \nto open Japan's markets. \n                                     END SUMMARY \n   EU Commissioner Leon Brittan, along with French and German \nleaders, have criticized the U.S. reinstatement of its Super 301 \ntrade law and the U.S. threat of sanctions against Japan, \ncharging that the measures run counter to multilateral agreements \nand that they border on \"managed trade\" because they aim at \nsetting numerical market share targets: \n   --EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan charged that the U.S. \nstrategy of negotiating market shares with Japan posed a risk for \nEurope, suggesting that if the Japanese complied it would be at \nEurope's expense (AFP, Reuter, 17 February).  Saying that the \nU.S. threat to impose sanctions amounted to \"managed trade,\" he \ncalled the U.S. decision to  reinstate Super 301 \"disappointing\" \nand said the EU would be studying the move carefully to see if it \nviolated U.S. trade commitments (AFP, 4 March).  On 10 March, \nBrittan charged that the United States was pursuing \n\"counterproductive and discriminatory tactics\" in the trade \npolicy dispute with Japan (Reuter, 10 March). \n   --EU foreign ministers meeting on 7 March issued a statement \nsaying Super 301 was \"contrary to the spirit\" of the GATT and \ncalling on the EU Commission to \"thoroughly investigate\" whether \nthe U.S. trade sanctions against Japan are a violation of GATT \n(AFP, 7 March). \n   French and German Reactions \n   As has charactistically occurred in recent trade differences \nbetween the United States and its European allies, the official \nFrench reaction to the reinstatement of Super 301 was more blunt \nand direct than the German response: \n   --French Prime Minister Balladur, tying Super 301 to U.S. threats \nto impose sanctions on French goods in retaliation for France's \nblocking of U.S. fish exports, accused the United States of \"not \nplaying by the rules\" of international trade, but he also hoped a \n\"reasonable\" solution could be found (AFP, 5 March). \n   --In an interview with Le Figaro following his 9-12 March trip to \nJapan, French Trade and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said \nFrance \"condemns any kind of unilateralism\" such as the U.S. \nreinstatement of the \"Super 301,\" calling instead for \"dialogue.\" \nHe also said Europe would take care to ensure that settlement of \nthe U.S.-Japan trade dispute did not have \"adverse effects\" on \nEuropean exports (15 March). \n   --In contrast, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's \nopposition to U.S. trade measures has been very muted.  He told \nan interviewer on 15 February that he \"opposed numerical targets\" \nbecause they were \"clearly against GATT\" and free trade (Reuter, \n15 February).  Similarly, on 4 March, he said Germany wanted \n\"better access\" to Asian markets but rejected \"unilateral action\" \nsuch as introducing sanctions because they \"cannot be reconciled\" \nwith the Uruguay Round (DPA, Reuter 4 March). \n   Seeking Cooperation \n   In spite of their critical remarks, EU leaders have also \nindicated a desire to defuse the trade conflicts and to join with \nthe United States in opening up Japan's markets, stressing that \nthey prefer a nonconfrontational approach that focuses on ways to \nmake European products attractive to the Japanese market rather \nthan merely on gaining market shares: \n   --On 4 March, Brittan repeated an EU proposal he had made on 17 \nFebruary for a \"trilateral\" EU-U.S.-Japan approach to opening \nJapan's markets that would identify and remove specific Japanese \nbarriers and would accept global targets, but not quotas or \ntargets for individual sectors.  Such an approach would be in \nline with the EU's approach exemplified by its \"Gateway to Japan\" \ninitiative, aimed at making European goods more attractive to the \nJapanese and using diplomatic pressure to overcome market access \ndifficulties (AFP, 4 March, 17 February). \n   --Longuet seemed to adopt a more conciliatory posture toward the \nU.S. in an interview with La Tribune Desfosses on 9 March. \nJustifying the EU foreign ministers' \"rather sof t condemnation\" \nof the Super 301 action at their 7 March meeting, he also \nremarked that Kantor had \"let us know\" that the U.S. decision on \nSuper 301 had been made to avoid more radical measures, given the \nviews of the U.S. Congress.  Longuet reportedly also had \nexpressed some sympathy for the U.S. threat of sanctions against \nJapan, telling Reuter on 3 March that the United States was \n\"right to remind the Japanese that trade is not a one-way \nbusiness\" (Reuter, 4 March). \n   --Rexrodt also said that Germany was \"alongside\" the United \nStates in pressing Japan to open its markets and was doing its \nbest to convince the Japanese that they need \"to restructure \ntheir society and their business structures.\"  Germany would \ndiscuss \"every measure and every pressure\" on the Japanese, \ninsisting that they must not just \"bow and promise\" but must also \nmake \"commitments,\" he said.  Nevertheless, he added, \"numerical \ntargets\" were \"clearly against GATT\" and free trade (Reuter, 15 \nFebruary). \n   French Media Reaction \n   French media reaction reflected concern that U.S. trade measures \ncould also be aimed at Europe but media commentary also indicated \nsome sympathy for, and even approval of, U.S. pressure on Japan. \n   --The influential Liberation of 4 March said President Clinton \nhad pulled out the \"heaviest weapon\" from his \"arsenal,\" Super \n301, following pressure from industrial lobbies and Congress to \nforce the Japanese to reduce their trade surplus.  It also noted \nthat while EU countries are publicly criticizing the unilateral \nU.S. approach, some leaders \"in private understand the American \nanger.\" \n   --The business daily Les Echos of 7 March voiced concern that \nU.S. Super 301 could be \"aimed at Europe or any other country\" \nand said it was \"unlikely\" the United States would give up any of \nits \"bilateral defense weapons in international trade.  A \ncommentary in the 16 February issue, on the other hand, viewed \nthe U.S. threat of sanctions against Japan as a \"sign of \nmoderation\" because it provided time \"to find a compromise\" and \nexpressed the hope that it would serve as a \"warning shot\" to \nJapan without opening \"excessive hostilities.\" \n   German Media Reaction \n   Although the leading German press criticized U.S. reinstatement \nof Super 301 as being contrary to the spirit of GATT and as a \npossible threat to European trade with Japan, some papers also \nexpressed sympathy for the U.S. moves to break down Japanese \ntrade barriers: \n   --The influential German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine called U.S. \nconcern about the \"horrendous\" Japanese trade surpluses \n\"understandable\" but said that minimum import quotas are a \"bad \nrelapse\" into \"state-regulated foreign trade\" (7 March).  It is \n\"clear and natural,\" the daily said,  that Washington is urging \nthe Japanese to remove their barriers to import competition, but \nthe United States is trying to \"forcibly\" clear a path for U.S. \nfirms and \"manipulate trade,\" taking measures that \"ignore\" GATT \nprinciples (14 March). \n   --The business daily Handelsblatt noted that U.S. patience was \n\"apparently exhausted\" because of the lack of progress in \nreducing Japanese trade surpluses.  Nevertheless, it called such \n\"unilateral measures,\" incompatible with the \"complexities\" of \nworld trade, saying that the \"dangerous aspect\" is that Super 301 \ncan be used not only against Japan but also against other trading \npartners (7 March). \n   --The left-of-center Frankfurter Rundschau of 19 February said \nEurope \"should not be fooled.\"  The U.S. \"first and foremost\" \nwants access to the Japanese consumers for itself and not for \neverybody, it charged, saying that President Clinton \"spoke for \nthe United States and not for GATT.\" \n(AUTHOR:  SHAVER.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                               Despite persistent Jordanian efforts to repair relations with \nSaudi Arabia--seriously strained since the Gulf crisis--King \nHusayn's religious pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina on 8 March \nyielded a sharp rebuff when King Fahd pointedly failed to receive \nHusayn and his top-level delegation.  Indicating official \nJordanian embarrassment over the Saudi snub, subsequent Jordanian \nmedia treatment of the visit suggests an effort to limit the \npolitical fallout by putting the best face possible on the visit. \n\n                           END SUMMARY \n\n   Although King Husayn officially traveled to Saudi Arabia to \nperform the 'umra, or minor pilgrimage, he evidently hoped to \neffect a public reconciliation with Fahd and overcome Saudi anger \nover Husayn's alleged sympathy for Iraq during the Gulf crisis. \nIndicative of the trip's political dimension, a large delegation \naccompanied the king on his first visit to Saudi Arabia following \na four-year hiatus. In addition to Princes 'Abdallah, Talal, and \nGhazi; the prime minister; the chief of the Royal Court; the \nking's adviser; the chief chamberlain; and the king's private \nsecretary, the delegation included the chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and \"a number of top state and military \nofficials\" (Amman radio, 8 March). \n   Moreover, in the months prior to King Husayn's arrival in Saudi \nArabia on 8 March, the Jordanian leadership made many flattering \nand conciliatory references to Saudi Arabia, revealing Amman's \nstrong desire for a rapid reconciliation and laying the \ngroundwork for the king's visit. \n   --During a news conference in Washington in January, the king \nsaid he hoped Amman-Riyadh relations would \"return to their \nwarmth.\"  Although he has always stopped short of an official, \npublic apology for Jordan's refusal to join the international \ncoalition against Iraq--something Riyadh evidently expects as a \ncondition for restoring ties--Husayn said that he hoped \"our \nbrethren in Saudi Arabia will realize that we never meant them \nany harm, nor did we cause them any harm at all\" (Amman TV, 27 \nJanuary). \n   --In a departure from previous Jordanian criticism of Saudi \nsponsorship of renovation projects for Islamic shrines in \nJerusalem (See Note 1), Crown Prince Hassan welcomed Saudi \nArabia's announced campaign to raise funds for the renovation of \nthe Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosques, lavishing praise on \nthe \"initiative\" by King Fahd, which \"clearly contributes to \nrealizing Arab solidarity\" (Amman radio, 22 February).  Hassan's \nremarks were echoed by the daily Al-Dustur, which hailed the \n\"well-timed Saudi step\" (23 February). \n   (Note 1) In May 1992, Jordan's information minister responded to \nnews of a Saudi donation to UNESCO on behalf of Jerusalem's \nIslamic shrines with a warning against \"any attempt to weaken the \nlegitimacy of the Jordanian role in Jerusalem\" (Amman radio, 20 \nMay 92).  Likewise, the English-language weekly The Star \ncriticized the Saudi move as \"myopic and rash\" (21-27 May 92), \nwhile the weekly Shihan denounced Riyadh's contribution to the \nshrines as \"a direct threat to Jerusalem and its Arab character\" \n(16 May 92). \n   At the time of the trip itself, monitored reports on Husayn's \npilgrimage broadcast by Jordan's state-run radio and television \nrefrained from discussing the political potential of the visit, \nfocusing instead on factual accounts of the king's religious \nactivities.  However, articles appearing in the semi-independent \npress during the king's pilgrimage undoubtedly fueled speculation \nabout a Saudi-Jordanian reconciliation. \n   --A column in the daily Sawt al-Sha'b indicated optimistic \nexpectations, stating that \"there is no denying we entertain high \nhopes\" for a reconciliation, and that \"we fervently hope to see \nAmman and Riyadh embrace in a long hug after a long \nestrangement.\"   The column also suggested that Arabs would \nsuffer \"further ignominy, humiliation, and division\" without \nmoves toward reconciliation (9 March). \n   --On the day of King Husayn's departure for Jeddah, the weekly \nAl-'Ahd, organ of the conservative al-'Ahd political party, \nspeculated about \"the meetings that will be held\" during the \nking's visit, adding that Jordanian \"nationalists\" had \"hope and \nconfidence in our ability to put the Gulf crisis behind us.\"  The \narticle underscored \"the big role the Saudi brothers can play\" in \ngiving Arab-Israeli peace negotiations added impetus (8 March). \n   --An editorial in the daily Al-Ra'y on 9 March--evidently \npublished prior to the news that Fahd did not meet Husayn- \n-optimistically opined that the king's minor pilgrimage would not \nbe \"limited to the religious aspect in terms of its importance,\" \nand anticipated that the Jordanian and Saudi \"brothers\" would \nfind the \"right moment to meet, settle differences, and reaffirm \nthat they have absorbed the lessons of past stages and the \ndangers of each upcoming stage.\" \n\n   Damage Control \n\n   Smarting from the Saudi snub and sensitive to possible public \ndisappointment, the Jordanian government has not been observed to \ncomment officially on the trip.  Media reports on the visit have \nbeen meager, although this was partially because of the non- \npublication of most Jordanian newspapers over the 'Id al-Fitr \nholiday.  Those reports that disclosed official disappointment \nwith the trip cited only unnamed government sources, while other \narticles evidently sought to mask the negative outcome by playing \nup the religious nature of the king's sojourn.  Still other \nreports claimed favorable results from the trip, giving King \nHusayn credit for his initiative and indicating that the ball was \nnow in the Saudi court. \n   --The English-language daily Jordan Times cited a source \"close \nto the palace\" as expressing disappointment that \"the king was \nreaching out in reconciliation, but King Fahd did not respond.\" \nAlthough there was no monitored official confirmation of a \nplanned Fahd-Husayn meeting, the Times cited official sources as \nhaving told the paper \"privately\" that the two kings had been \nslated to meet on 8 March for the first time since the outbreak \nof the Gulf crisis.  Another anonymous \"well-placed source\" cited \nby the Times said the king was aware his trip to Saudi Arabia \nwould be a \"purely spiritual visit.\"  Nonetheless, the same \nofficial credited the king with having broken \"a psychological \nbarrier\" with Saudi Arabia by making the trip after four years of \nstaying away (10 March). \n   --The weekly Akhbar Al-Usbu' published an unsigned article \nplaying down the disappointing outcome of Husayn's visit, and \ngiving the king credit for his effort.  Jordan, it said, had \nchosen to rise \"above the pan-Arab wounds to heal the rift which \nafflicted the Arab homeland after the Gulf war, for the sake of \nrestoring Arab solidarity and reactivating joint Arab action that \ncan confront the serious challenges threatening the Arab and \nIslamic nation.\"  The king's \"gesture,\" it noted, was \"not new,\" \nbut stemmed from \"the continuous role the Hashemites have played \nin unifying the Arabs and Muslims throughout the ages\" (10 \nMarch). \n\n   Saudi Media Response \n\n   In line with the government's silence, official Saudi media were \nnot observed to report or comment on King Husayn's arrival, \npilgrimage activities, or departure.  Domestic Saudi newspapers \nwere similarly observed to contain no mention of the king's \nvisit.  Curiously, two London-based Saudi-owned papers--which \nexercise somewhat more editorial flexibility than their domestic \ncounterparts--evidently anticipated that a Fahd-Husayn meeting \nwould occur, perhaps influenced by speculation on the matter \nwithin the diplomatic community.  Al-Sharq Al-Awsat on 8 March \nquoted King Husayn's alleged \"personal apologies to King Fahd\" \nfor their adversarial Gulf war relationship,  while Al-Hayah on 9 \nMarch actually reported that King Fahd had \"received the \nJordanian monarch\" the previous evening \"in holy Mecca.\" \n\n   Implications \n\n   The public optimism regarding hopes for a reconciliation with \nSaudi Arabia appears to have embarrassed the government in the \nwake of the king's return to Jordan without having met with King \nFahd.  Although prospects for a reconciliation were never \nofficially confirmed, the widespread media speculation clearly \nindicated that a Fahd-Husayn meeting had been expected by the \ngovernment--particularly since Fahd had received former Gulf war \nadversary PLO Chairman 'Arafat during the latter's minor \npilgrimage in January.  Nevertheless, Fahd's decision not to \nreceive Husayn, as well as the complete silence of Saudi Arabia's \nofficial media, suggest that Saudi Arabia will expect further \nmeasures--such as a more explicit public expression of Jordanian \ncontrition for its stance during the Gulf war--if the \nlongstanding impasse is to be broken.  Following this episode, \nany further attempts by King Husayn to mend fences with Saudi \nArabia will likely be through private and diplomatic channels, \nand will carry a low media profile--at least until the prospects \nfor success are guaranteed by Riyadh. \n(AUTHOR:  MURRAY.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                               President Boris Yeltsin continues to face serious opposition from \ncertain regions in his efforts to define a division of central \nand local authority.  Several republics failed to approve the \nfederal constitution in the 12 December referendum and have since \ntaken fresh steps toward enacting republic constitutions that \nclaim greater powers for local authorities.  In the case of \nTatarstan, Moscow has dealt with the conflict by signing a \nbilateral treaty after prolonged negotiations, but it is not yet \nclear if Moscow is willing to conclude such treaties with other \nrepublics. \n\n                           END SUMMARY \n\n   Rejection of the federal constitution by voters in several \nrepublics in the 12 December referendum and recent moves to \napprove republic constitutions that assert regional authority in \nways incompatible with the Federation constitution demonstrate \nthat the republics' constitutional conflict with Moscow remains a \nserious issue: \n\n   -- The Tuvan republic held a referendum to approve the republic's \nconstitution on 12 December, the same day as the referendum on \nthe federal constitution.  While the Tuvan constitution, approved \nby 53.9 percent of the voters in the referendum, formally \nacknowledges the republic to be part of the Russian Federation \n(Ostankino TV, 27 October 1993), it also \"envisages the right to \nself-determination\" (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993).  It provides \nfor a 32-member republic parliament, the Supreme Hural, whose \nmembership was also elected on 12 December. The republic's \nconstitution gives parliament authority to decide \"problems of \nwar and peace, borders,\" and to suspend Russian Federation \nlegislative acts which \"go beyond the powers envisaged by the \nconstitution of the Russian Federation, the federal treaty or \nother agreements\" (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993).  Only 30.5 \npercent of Tuvan voters approved the federal constitution on 12 \nDecember. \n\n   -- The constitution of the republic of Bashkortostan, adopted on \n24 December 1993 by 206 out of 227 republic Supreme Soviet \ndeputies (Segodnya, 28 December 1993; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 \nDecember 1993), claims precedence over the federal constitution, \nat least in some provisions.  The Bashkortostan constitution \nprovides that the republic will voluntarily yield to Moscow \ncertain powers pertaining to interstate relations under terms of \nan as yet to be negotiated treaty with the Russian Federation but \nretain authority over its judicial system and prosecutor's \noffice, independent foreign economic and foreign policy affairs, \nand entrance into interstate associations (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, \n28 December 1993).  The republic's constitution also asserts \"the \nland, its contents, natural wealth, and other natural resources \non its territory\" to be \"the property of its multinational \npeople\" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 December 1993).  Fifty-three \npercent of the Bashkortostan electorate voted against the federal \nconstitution in the 12 December referendum (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, \n16 December). \n\n   -- Tatarstan also rejected the federal constitution on 12 \nDecember as fewer than fourteen percent of the republic's \nelectorate participated in the referendum (Izvestiya, 14 December \n1993).  In November 1992, the republic Supreme Soviet approved a \nrepublic constitution that states that Tatarstan's laws \"take \nprecedence throughout its territory, unless they conflict with \ninternational commitments of the republic,\" and that the republic \nconstitution \"is an act of the highest legal force of direct \neffect\" and declares the republic a \"sovereign state\" and \n\"subject of international law\" (Sovetskaya Tatariya, 13 December \n1992).  The constitution associates the republic with the Russian \nFederation only within the parameters of a bilateral treaty that \ndivides Federation and republic authority (see box) (Interfax, 6 \nNovember 1992). \n\n   Moscow is also engaged in a constitutional conflict with \nSverdlovsk oblast over the oblast's bid to claim republic status. \nUnder the leadership of former oblast Governor Eduard Rossel, \nresidents of the Sverdlovsk region are seeking formal recognition \nfor the Urals republic, favored by 83 percent of voters (with a \n55 percent voter turnout) in a 25 April 1993 non-binding \nreferendum (Interfax, 1 July 1993) and proclaimed by a decision \nof the oblast soviet (Izvestiya, 3 July 1993).  Despite being \nfired by Yeltsin for backing the move to claim republic status, \nRossel was given a vote of confidence as 61.87 percent of the \nSverdlovsk Oblast electorate endorsed him for a seat in the \nFederation Council (Interfax, 13 December 1993).  Rossel has \nsucceeded in getting a debate on approval of the constitution of \nthe Urals Republic on the Federation Council's agenda (Izvestiya, \n10 February).  Claiming that the establishment of the Urals \nRepublic and adoption of its constitution were made \"in full \nconformity\" with the federal constitution, Rossel asserted he is \n\"ready\" to appeal to the Constitutional Court to approve the \nrepublic constitution (ITAR-TASS, 17 January). \n\n   Tatarstan Negotiations \n\n   Moscow's response to the conflict with Tatarstan has been to \nengage in protracted negotiations with the republic, talks which \nhave ended in mutual agreement on a treaty.  Culminating three \nyears of negotiations with Kazan, Moscow's future relations with \nthe republic will be based on the bilateral \"Treaty on the Mutual \nDelegation of Authority and Terms of Reference,\" signed on 15 \nFebruary by Yeltsin and Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev \n(ITAR-TASS, 15 February) (See Box). \n\n   The Moscow-Kazan bilateral treaty is supplemented by twelve \nintergovernmental agreements.  According to Kommersant-Daily, the \nagreements concern oil production, ownership matters, defense \nindustries, customs, transportation of oil products, \nenvironmental cooperation, education, the budget, banking system, \nforeign economic activity, crime, and military organization (5 \nFebruary). \n   Treaty as a Model \n\n   Since the signing of the Russia-Tatarstan bilateral treaty, \nYeltsin and Shakhray have hailed the treaty as a \"precedent\" for \nnegotiating similar agreements with other components: \n\n   -- Following the treaty signing, Yeltsin stressed that \"treaties \nof this kind are, basically, the sole constitutional way of \nremoving contradictions between the Russian Federation \nconstitution and republic constitutions in a civilized way, \nwithout twisting anyone's arm\" (ITAR-TASS, 15 February). \n\n   -- Shakhray was quoted as saying that \"there is a legal and \neconomic possibility of the conclusion of treaties similar to \nthat with Tataria with each component of the Russian Federation,\" \nbased on \"Article 11 of the Constitution . . . clause 3 of which \nsays that the terms of reference shall be delineated \"by this \nconstitution and the Federal and other treaties\" (Segodnya, 25 \nFebruary).  According to a 15 February Interfax report, Shakhray \nwould like to see Federal Assembly adoption of a law on power- \nsharing as a way of regulating the process. \n\n   Detractors characterize the Russia-Tatarstan treaty as a threat \nto federalism, saying it will complicate future center-regional \nrelations and unacceptably weaken the center: \n\n   -- Sergey Baburin, State Duma deputy and leader of the \nunregistered \"Russian Way\" faction, viewed the treaty as a threat \nto federalism and submitted a Duma proposal \"On Guarantees of the \nFederal System and Provision for Territorial Integrity of the \nRussian Federation On Account of the Signing of the Treaty with \nTatarstan,\" which apparently failed for lack of votes. \nExplaining his proposal, Baburin was quoted as saying that \"for \nthe first time the state signed a treaty with a part of itself\" \nand that the treaty presents \"a great danger because it means the \nstate's transition to a confederative system\" (Interfax, 16 \nFebruary). \n\n   -- In a 16 February article, Segodnya commentator Vladimir Todres \nsuggested that pursuing separate treaties for each region would \nproduce gridlock and confusion.  He wrote, \"Russia has a further \n87 regions, not counting Chechnya.  The question \"If the Tatars \ncan do it, why can't we?\" is quite natural.  Why should the other \nregional leaders swallow this treaty in silence?\" \n\n   Other Republics \n\n   While Moscow and Kazan were putting the finishing touches on the \ntreaty, Moscow still appeared to be pressing the other republics \nto revise their constitutions, remaining noncommital on a \nwillingness to conclude other treaties. \n\n   In the case of at least one republic, Bashkortostan, Moscow \nappears to have opened negotiations on a set of agreements \nsimilar to those it signed with Tatarstan.  According to republic \nPrime Minister Anatoliy Kopsov, the signing of the treaty with \nTatarstan \"gave the latest impetus\" to the resumption of talks \nbetween Moscow and Bashkortostan.  He said that the negotiators \nwere working on a treaty and a package of bilateral economic, \nsocial, and cultural agreements, some of which are \"practically \nready for signing\" (Interfax, 17 March).  Moscow officials have \nnot been observed to comment on these negotiations. \n\n   Before the Moscow-Kazan treaty signing, Moscow urged \nconstitutional reform in a unilateral effort to rein in the \nregions.  Members of the Council of Heads of Administrations \nunder President Yeltsin had reportedly advised the formation of a \ncommission that would bring the constitutions of republics \"in \nline\" with the federal constitution.  The Council cited \"a number \nof norms\" in which component constitutions \"contradict\" the \nfederation's.  Nikolay Medvedev, head of the presidential \nAdministration's Directorate for Work with the Territories, \nplaced \"special emphasis\" on twelve republics that still have \n\"old\" constitutions (See Note 1), and five newly established \nrepublics, Adygey, Altai, Ingushetia, Karachayevo-Cherkessia, and \nKhakassiya, which do not yet have their own constitutions \n(Interfax, 6 January; Russian Television, 6 January). \n\n   (Note 1)  To illustrate his point, Medvedev reportedly cited the \nrepublic of Mordovia, which \"by its constitution is still a \nsoviet socialist republic\" (Interfax, 6 January).  The Mordovian \nSSR has since been renamed the Republic of Mordovia (Ostankino \nTV, 26 January). \n\n   Republics' Response \n\n   To date, only a few republics have signaled willingness to amend \ntheir draft constitutions in response to Moscow's objections and \nthe criticism from the Council of Heads of Administrations: \n\n   -- In its 11 January issue, Izvestiya reported that the \nKabardino-Balkar Republic's parliament approved a package of \nproposals from republic President Valeriy Kokov to \"alter\" and \n\"supplement\" the republic constitution so that it complies with \nthe federal constitution. \n\n   -- According to a 19 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta article, the \nKomi Republic constitution \"corresponds\" with the federal \nconstitution.  Adopted on 17 February by a majority vote of the \nrepublic Supreme Soviet, the republic constitution proclaims Komi \nas a sovereign formation within the Russian Federation (Radio \nRossii, 17 February).  According to Russian TV, even before its \nadoption the draft constitution for the Komi Republic was \nrecognized as an attempt to incorporate \"the principles of \nterritorial sovereignty on the basis of Russian federalism\" (24 \nJanuary). \n\n   -- In a 27 February referendum, 97.6 percent of voters approved \nthe constitution of Ingushetia, which declares the republic a \n\"democratic, rule-of-law state, part of the Russian Federation on \na treaty basis\" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 2 March).  Employees of the \nrepublic Justice Ministry had underscored the need to put the \nIngush constitution in line with the federal constitution before \nthe scheduled referendum (ITAR-TASS, 23 January).  Ingushetia's \nconciliatory response may be linked to the federation \ngovernment's mediating role in an Ingush-North Ossetian \nterritorial dispute as an attempt to gain the federation \ngovernment's favor. \n\n   -- The republic of Buryatia reportedly passed a new constitution \nthat appears to follow the model set by Tatarstan.  Having \nreceived a unanimous vote of confidence by the republic Supreme \nSoviet, Buryatia's constitution reportedly states that the \nrepublic is a \"sovereign, democratic, law-governed state within \nthe Russian Federation,\" and that its relations with Moscow will \nbe \"built on a constitutional, treaty-based foundation\" \n(Ostankino TV, 22 February). \n\n   -- According to republic Supreme Soviet First Deputy Chairman \nBagaudin Akhmedov, the new constitution of Dagestan calls for \n\"the building of a single, sovereign, democratic state within the \nRussian Federation (Segodnya, 1 March). \n   Implications \n\n   Despite Yeltsin's and Shakhray's endorsements of the Moscow-Kazan \nbilateral treaty as a model, it is not clear that Moscow is \nactually prepared to conclude similar treaties with the other \nrepublics.  Although Shakhray has reemerged as a player in \nnationality affairs after a period of relative eclipse, his \nposition within the government remains clouded, somewhat diluting \nthe value of his endorsement.  The other republics, probably \nviewing the treaty as a success for Kazan, will likely press \nMoscow to give them a similar deal. \n\nBox \n\n                    The Moscow-Kazan Treaty: \n                       Who won? Who lost? \n\n   Officials have made conflicting statements on the specifics on \nthe bilateral treaty, but media reportage suggests that both \nRussia and Tatarstan made concessions in the treaty's final \ndraft: \n\n   -- Although Tatarstan may now \"take part in international \nrelations and foreign economic activity\" (ITAR-TASS, 15 February) \nand--according to republic President Mintimer Shaymiyev--the \ntreaty \"recognizes the right to self-determination . . . and \ndefense of sovereignty\" (ITAR-TASS, 16 February), the words \nsovereign state\" and \"subject of international law\" were \nreportedly removed from the treaty draft (Krasnaya Zvezda, 17 \nFebruary). \n\n   -- The treaty reportedly gives Tatarstan \"exclusive\" ownership \nand use of the land on its territory and its contents, and all \nproperty (ITAR-TASS, 16 February). \n\n   -- According to a 17 February Krasnaya Zvezda article, Tatarstan \nreportedly had to abandon its plans to establish a \"single- \nchannel\" taxation system in favor of the \"general federal \nscheme.\" \n\n   -- Although Shaymiyev has reportedly described the outcome of the \nnegotiations as \"a change in [Tatarstan's] status . . . within \nRussia\" (Krasnaya Zvezda, 17 February), Minister of Nationality \nAffairs and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray has countered that \nthe treaty \"provides neither for upgrading nor for downgrading \nthe status of Tatarstan\" (Interfax, 18 February). \n\n   Shaymiyev stated that the Moscow-Kazan treaty will not have to be \nratified, as the federal and Tatarstan constitutions only require \nparliamentary ratification of international treaties (Kazanskiye \nVedomosti, 22 February). \n\nEnd Box \n\n(AUTHOR:  NERO.

Although the statement \ncarried the standard warning against applying pressure on \nPyongyang and charges of Western plans to \"crush\" the DPRK, its \nmajor complaint seemed to be that the IAEA is convening a Board \nof Governors meeting--reportedly for 21 March (Yonhap, 17 March)- \n-\"even before\" analyzing the results of the just concluded \ninspections, having \"hastily\" reached the \"unjust\" conclusion \nthat \"it cannot guarantee\" non-diversion of nuclear materials. \n   (NOTE: The department was previously known as the Ministry of \nAtomic Energy Industry.  Pyongyang media have not been observed \nto report on the apparent reorganization.) \n   The statement, which made it clear that Pyongyang had allowed the \nIAEA inspection this time solely to facilitate DPRK-U.S. high- \nlevel talks,(SEE NOTE) noted areas of basic disagreement with the \nIAEA.  This disagreement is due, the statement claimed, to the \ninspection team's attempts to go beyond the contents of a 15 \nMarch bilateral agreement reached in Vienna with the IAEA. \nAccording to Pyongyang: \n   + The IAEA inspection team unfairly maintained that the \ninspections were being conducted under Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty (NPT) safeguards.  The North Korean statement claimed that \nPyongyang had agreed only to allow inspections \"purely\" to ensure \ncontinuity of the safeguards, reiterating Pyongyang's contention \nthat its \"special status\" of having only \"temporarily suspended\" \nwithdrawal from the NPT exempts it from normal safeguards \nobligations. \n   + The IAEA's insistence on 1) extracting samples in sealed-off \nareas where the seals remained intact; 2) gamma radiation mapping \nat all points, instead of selected points; and 3) examining \"the \ncooling system,\"  went beyond what is needed to merely ensure \ncontinuity of the safeguards.  Such inspections, the statement \nmaintained, would have made the inspections \"equivalent\" to \nroutine and ad hoc inspections required under the safeguards. \n   (NOTE: Underscoring Pyongyang's eagerness to resume high-level \nbilateral talks with Washington, North Korean Ambassador to \nMoscow Son Song-pil has reiterated Pyongyang's contention that \nthe DPRK-U.S. talks, once held, will serve as \"an important \noccasion\" to solve the nuclear issue and will also lead to \"easy \nresolution\" of pending inter-Korean issues (Pyongyang radio, 18 \nMarch).) \n   Charges of \"Pressure\" Tactics     The statement complained that \nthe IAEA had sent three messages to Pyongyang during the \ninspection, \"threatening\" to \"report to the Board of Governors \nthat the agency is not in a position to verify non-diversion of \nnuclear materials\" unless its demands were met.  However, in \nwarning against such \"pressure\" tactics, the North Korean \nstatement said that any attempts at pressuring the DPRK \"would \nlead to a situation in which we would have no choice but to take \na decisive measure to counter them.\"  The statement went on to \npledge that Pyongyang will watch to see if the IAEA \"intends to \nresolve our nuclear issue fairly or attempts to use it for \npolitical aims\"--a relatively circumspect formulation that would \nappear to allow Pyongyang a certain range of latitude in judging \nIAEA action on the inspection issue. \n   Implications     Although the statement seemed to leave little \nroom for compromise, it did stop short of an ultimatum, adopting \ninstead a wait-and-see attitude toward future IAEA action.  These \ncaveats suggests that Pyongyang is trying to protect the \npossibility of engaging in bilateral talks with Washington by \nsomehow preventing referral of the nuclear issue to the UN \nSecurity Council. \n   (AUTHOR:  YIM.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n                            Seeking to exploit what he perceives to be a rift in the \ncoalition that liberated Kuwait, President Saddam Husayn has \npresented the UN Security Council with a virtual ultimatum, \nthreatening implicitly that if it fails to take significant steps in \ncoming weeks toward lifting the sanctions, Iraq may cease to \ncooperate with the UN Special Commission and adopt a confrontational \nposture.  Coming amid signs that the sanctions are causing \nincreasing economic difficulties in Iraq, Saddam's move reflects his \nimpatience with the Security Council's failure to lift the sanctions \nin response to Baghdad's diplomacy and selective compliance, his \ndesire to frustrate effective future monitoring of Iraqi weapons \nprograms, and his unwillingness to make further concessions in \ncompliance with UN resolutions -- such as recognizing the border \nwith Kuwait. \n                       END SUMMARY \n   In a 13 March speech, which Iraqi media played up as an ultimatum \nthreatening confrontation if a date for lifting the sanctions is not \nset, Saddam demanded that the Security Council implement Paragraph \n22 of Resolution 687 -- allowing Iraq to resume its oil sales -- \n\"immediately and without any conditions.\"  He warned that if Deputy \nPrime Minister Tariq 'Aziz returns from the UN Security Council \nsession without the Council's agreement to activate Paragraph 22, \nthen Iraq's people and leadership would have \"no choice but to \ndecide what they believe will give them hope . . . in the direction \nthey believe is sound\" (Baghdad radio). \n   Media Highlight Speech \n   Tightly controlled Iraqi media immediately began to portray \nSaddam's speech as an ultimatum and to prepare the Iraqi public for \nconfrontation.  For example: \n   -- The daily Babil, owned by Saddam's son 'Udayy, said that \nSaddam's speech \"defined the contents of the decisive Iraqi \nconfrontation with the enemies\" (Iraqi News Agency [INA], 17 March). \n   -- The daily Al-Qadisiyah (See Note 1) claimed Saddam's speech \ngave the Security Council \"the last chance . . . to lift the \nsanctions without delay or conditions\" (INA, 15 March). \n   (Note 1) Around mid-September 1993, Al-Qadisiyah was removed \nfrom the supervision of the Defense Ministry and affiliated with the \nInformation Ministry, which now controls this paper as well as Al- \nJumhuriyah (Al-'Iraq, 18 September 1993).  Probably more than an \neconomy measure, this change, made by a Revolution Command Council \ndecree, may have been designed to limit the political power of the \nDefense Ministry. \n   -- Interpreting Saddam's speech as threatening an end to or \nreduction in Iraqi cooperation with the United Nations, the Ba'th \nParty daily Al-Thawrah said that if the Security Council does not \nlift the sanctions, Iraq will choose \"a new road, different . . . in \nterms of its approach to [UN] resolutions and committees,\" a road \nthat will prove Iraq has \"other options\" aside from cooperating with \n\"colonialist interpretations of UN resolutions\" (INA, 15 March). \n   Earlier Signs \n   Saddam had already foreshadowed a possible change of policy in \nhis 16 January Gulf war anniversary speech, in which he pledged that \n\"we will not relinquish our people in the northern part of the \nhomeland, nor will we stand idle toward the continuation of the \nblockade and the violation of our sovereignty in southern Iraq.\"  In \nthat speech, he also warned \"all evildoers, masters and satellites\" \n- and especially \"some evildoers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait\" -- \nnot to \"miscalculate\" because \"the punishment of the criminals is an \neye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\" (Baghdad radio). \n   Explaining the Shift \n   In his 13 March speech, Saddam explained that a shift from \ndiplomacy to confrontation may prove necessary because Iraqis who \nadvocated concessions seem to have been wrong while Iraqi hardliners \nseem to have been right.  He said Iraq had \"thus far\" employed \n\"diplomatic efforts\" to achieve \"a better level of understanding by \nthe Security Council\" because \"many people in our country\" had \n\"expected\" that this policy \"would make some people, whose hearts \nhave no feeling, show a flexible position and open the doors again \nto the Iraqi people.\" \n   Saddam contrasted Iraqis who favored the diplomatic policy with \nother Iraqis who were \"quite convinced that the criminal level of \naggression and the way sanctions were implemented . . . came from \nminds without any conscience.\"  He said these Iraqis, evidently now \nincluding himself, believed that \"despite Iraq's offers and \nresponses,\" its diplomats would discover that \"there is nothing \nbeing given in return\" and that the Security Council's Paragraph 22 \nis being used merely as a \"tactical cover to make Iraq fulfill its \nobligations\" while the Security Council fails to fulfill its own \nobligations. \n   Minimum Demands \n   Indicating his minimum demands, Saddam castigated UN Special \nCommission Chairman Rolf Ekeus for failing to provide a timetable \nstating when the probationary period for monitoring Iraqi weapons \nproduction would begin and end.  Saddam insisted that the Iraqis \nmust know when they can start selling oil so that they \"will be able \nto make their plans, see what they can do, and prepare themselves \npsychologically and economically for the required duration.\" \n   Saddam also revealed his resentment that Ekeus was working to \nturn UN Security Council Resolution 715 into an effective monitoring \ninstrument.  He claimed Ekeus had said that as soon as Iraq approved \nof 715, he would write a report to the Security Council, but when \nIraq approved it, Ekeus said, in Saddam's words, \"we must first \nstart monitoring and make sure that Iraq is implementing 715 the way \nwe want -- the way Ekeus wants  -- in order to make sure Iraq is \ncommitted.\"  Saddam claimed that the probationary monitoring period \nshould have started as soon as the two cameras to monitor missile \ntesting were installed and turned on. \n   'Aziz Letter \n   In a letter to the UN Security Council president on 16 March, \n'Aziz reiterated that Iraq \"demands\" that the Council apply \nParagraph 22 \"immediately and without any additional restrictions or \nconditions\" and that it \"reject the tendentious political \ninterpretations of its resolutions that some states are seeking to \nimpose on the Council.\"  Rejection of Iraq's demand, he said, would \n\"certainly lead to a reassessment of the situation and to an action \n[tasarruf] that will protect the Iraqi people from the harm to which \nthey are being exposed.\" \n   Indicating that at least for now Iraq will not recognize Kuwait \nand the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, as required by UN Security Council \nResolution 833, 'Aziz said that if the sanctions and the no-fly \nzones are lifted, the issue of Kuwait \"could then be discussed in \naccordance with the rules regulating relations among states\" \n(Baghdad radio, 17 March). (See Box 1) \n   Perceived Rift \n   Baghdad appears to believe that now is an opportune moment to \nexploit what it perceives as a serious rift within the alliance that \nliberated Kuwait.  For example, the Information Ministry's \nmouthpiece Al-Jumhuriyah has claimed that the United States has \nbecome \"virtually isolated in its calls for the continued \nenforcement of sanctions against Iraq, particularly since it has \nseen with its own eyes the disintegration of its international \ncoalition\" (INA, 6 March).  Iraqi media have recently listed France, \nRussia, and China as among the countries showing understanding for \nBaghdad's position.  In a recent article, Saddam's press secretary \n'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin advocated using a policy of \"intimidation\" and \n\"temptation,\" denying trade benefits, priority in debt payments, and \nother benefits to \"any country not currently adopting a just and \nequitable stand\" and offering corresponding benefits to countries \nnow helping Iraq to lift the sanctions (Babil, 24 February). \n   Information Ministry First Under Secretary Nuri Najm al-Marsumi \nargued in Al-'Iraq -- the daily of the pro-Saddam Kurds -- that \nIraqi diplomacy and U.S. mistakes had helped create \"a serious \nfissure within the anti-Iraq alliance\" and that \"current \ninternational and regional circumstances\" provide Iraq with \"a \nserious and true opportunity for lifting the unfair embargo.\" \nTherefore, he said, Iraq must \"draw the world's attention\" to its \ndetermination and capability \"not to remain idle\" if the sanctions \ncontinue and to its current \"rallying\" around Saddam \"to thwart the \naggression once and for all and to achieve the decisive victory\" (8 \nMarch). (See Box 2) \n   Implications \n   Saddam clearly is unwilling to recognize Kuwait, as required by \nUN Security Council Resolution 833, unable to stay in power without \nrepressing his people, as required by Resolution 688, and surprised \nby Ekeus' determination to treat Resolution 715 as an effective \nmeans of monitoring Iraqi weapons.  Nevertheless, he seems to \nbelieve that to protect his proclaimed status as \"Iraq's historic \nleader\" and to avoid being perceived as weak, he needs to manipulate \nthe Security Council into setting a date for Iraq to resume selling \nits oil.  He is therefore hoping that his threat to adopt a new, \npresumably more confrontational policy will break up the U.S.-led \ncoalition and erode the sanctions. \n   If his ultimatum is rejected, Saddam will almost certainly feel \ncompelled to do something to carry out his threat.  He may be \ncontent with an intensified propaganda campaign, directed in \nparticular to Arab and Islamic countries, and with repeatedly \nthreatening and then carrying out a gradual reduction or sudden \ncessation in Iraq's present degree of cooperation with the United \nNations.  However, one cannot rule out Saddam's giving up on efforts \nto lift sanctions and therefore seeking a victory in another area, \nsuch as a move to regain control of Iraqi Kurdistan. \n                 Box 1:  Denying Kuwaiti Legitimacy \n   Saddam's consideration of a change of policy is based partly on \nhis unwillingness to go any further to comply with UN resolutions. \nFor example, Iraqi leaders and media have signaled their continuing \nintention not to recognize the legitimacy of Kuwait, its government, \nor its border with Iraq. \n   -- In an address to pro-Saddam foreign visitors on 18 January, \nSaddam personally denied the legitimacy of the Kuwaiti rulers, \nclaiming that by their own actions they had lost the right to rule. \nAfter accusing them of lying in 1990 in order to make the U.S. \npublic \"accept the idea of war\" against Iraq, he said that \"when a \nMuslim ruler lies, then he has lost every legitimate right to be a \nruler\" (INA). \n   -- Commenting on Saddam's statement in his 16 January Gulf war \nanniversary speech that \"we will not turn wisdom into a prelude for \nweakness and despair,\" Information Ministry First Under Secretary \nal-Marsumi explained that, while \"wisdom and necessity\" have led \nIraq \nto accept UN Security Council resolutions, Iraq will not simply \nagree to \"whatever it is asked for.\"  In particular, it will not \n\"guarantee the security of the bandits, the rulers of the Kuwait \ngovernorate and Saudi Arabia\" despite the fact that this is what \n\"the Americans want\" (Babil, 2O January). \n   -- The practice of referring to Kuwait as the [Iraqi] \n\"governorate of Kuwait\" has continued (for example, Al-Jumhuriyah \neditor Salah al-Mukhtar in an article in Babil, 3O January; Babil, \n1O and 12 February).  More recently, Saddam's press secretary 'Abd \nal-Jabbar Muhsin has repeatedly referred to Kuwait as \"Kazimah,\" the \nIraqi-imposed name for Kuwait City under the occupation (Babil, 10 \nMarch). \n                   End of Box 1 \n               Box 2: Economic Deterioration \n   Official efforts to prepare the public for a change in policy \nhave come amid signs of increasing economic deterioration that \nBaghdad perceives as a threat to Iraqi steadfastness and morale. \nFor example: \n   --  A Babil editorial under a pseudonym used by Saddam's son \n'Udayy castigated the Cabinet for decisions that allegedly caused \nthe dinar's exchange rate to plummet between September 1993 and \nJanuary 1994, thereby allowing Iraq's \"enemy\" to make \"some gains in \nthe arena of the economic battle.\"  The editorial, citing a UN \nstatement that called for deferring any discussion of lifting the \nembargo until Iraq's good will had been tested for a year, implied \nthat Iraq could not last another year unless the dinar's slide is \nreversed.  It therefore suggested that the success or failure of a \nministry should be judged by its contribution to the strength or \nweakness of the dinar (2O January). \n   -- Saddam's press secretary 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin attacked \"a \nhandful of misled Iraqis\" who \"raise prices whenever the enemy \nescalates its onslaught and its conspiracies\" and who have become a \ndanger to Iraqi \"morale and steadfastness\" (Al-Qadisiyah, 22 \nFebruary). \n   -- The 1994 budget and investment plan was 25 percent below the \n1993 figures (Baghdad radio, 29 December). \n                     End of Box 2 \n   (AUTHOR:  BUDER.

        "text": "\n\nSUMMARY \n\n                          In a string of confrontational actions and pronouncements, \nPyongyang has raised the stakes further in its high-stakes \nnuclear issues game by threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty (NPT).  Although apparently unwilling to \npublicly concede that its own recent actions have damaged the \nchances for resumption of high-level U.S.-North Korea dialogue, \nPyongyang appears to be trying to somehow salvage bilateral talks \nwith Washington. \n\n                        END SUMMARY \n\n  Pyongyang Threatens NPT Withdrawal, Calls for U.S. Talks \n\n\nPyongyang's threat to withdraw from the NPT came in an \nauthoritative Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement issued on 21 \nMarch (Pyongyang radio, 21 March).  In the statement Pyongyang \nsaid it will \"carry into practice\" its declaration of NPT \nwithdrawal announced on 12 March 1993 under certain conditions: \n\n+ If the United States refuses bilateral talks with North Korea \nand resumes Team Spirit, thereby \"increasing its nuclear threat\" \nagainst the DPRK. \n\n+ If the IAEA \"further expands it unfairness\" by \"distorting\" the \nresults of its recent inspections in North Korea and resorts to \n\"forcible measures and pressures.\" \n\nThe 21 March statement, which for the first time acknowledged \nthat the DPRK-U.S. talks scheduled for the same day in Geneva did \nnot take place, also repeated familiar North Korean charges of \nU.S. violations of previous agreements with North Korea and \ndeclared that Pyongyang will \"no longer\" be duty-bound to ensure \ncontinuity of NPT safeguards. \n\nHint of Moderation     Possibly seeking to soften its threat--and \nthus somehow leave the door ajar for dialogue with Washington- \n-the statement seemed to imply that as long as there is any hope \nof resuming bilateral talks with Washington, Pyongyang may \nrefrain from taking the final step of NPT withdrawal.  North \nKorean withdrawal from the NPT, the statement said, would occur \nonly if the United States \"persists in avoiding\" bilateral talks \n\"to the end.\"  Underscoring Pyongyang's reluctance to \ndefinitively rule out future talks, the statement asserted that \nthe DPRK is \"in no hurry at all\"--presumably, to foreclose \navenues of dialogue with Washington--\"even if the DPRK-U.S. talks \nare not held.\"  In addition, in contrast to North Korean \npronouncements on the inter-Korean talks (see following article), \nthe statement, like previous pronouncements on Washington's \npolicy, refrained from extreme polemical attacks on Washington. \n\nPyongyang media also appeared to react with similar \ncircumspection to recent statements by high U.S. officials \ncriticizing the North.  For example, monitored North Korean media \nso far have not reported or commented on CIA Director Woolsey's \ncharges that Pyongyang has been exporting weapons of mass \ndestruction, is supporting terrorism, and may already possess \nnuclear weapons (Yonhap, 18 March). \n\nImplications     Pyongyang clearly prefers to deal only with \nWashington on the nuclear issue.  However, it seems unwilling or \nunable to acknowledge that its own dilatory and confrontational \ntactics are damaging the prospects for the dialogue it is \nseeking. \n\n  Pyongyang Breaks Off Talks With Seoul, Threatens War \n\n                             SUMMARY \n\nAccusing Seoul of engaging in pressure tactics, Pyongyang has \nabruptly broken off bilateral talks and issued threats of war- \n-threats that it subsequently appeared to moderate.  North Korea \napparently hopes to gain from what it sees as differences within \nthe ROK Government and between Seoul and Washington on the \nnuclear issue. \n\n                            END SUMMARY \n\nThe North came to Panmunjom on 19 March clearly prepared to break \noff the ongoing negotiations with the South on the exchange of \npresidential envoys.  The North Korean chief delegate--identified \nin Seoul media as Pak Yong-su--not only reinstated demands that \nhe had previously indicated would be retracted, but also insisted \nthat the ROK Government \"apologize\" to all Koreans--a formulation \nPyongyang had typically used in the past to signal its \nnoninterest in dialogue with Seoul and Tokyo--this time for \nallegedly obstructing DPRK-U.S. high-level talks (Pyongyang \nradio, 19 March). \n\nThe North's main complaint against the South focused on what Pak \ndescribed as Seoul's \"sudden change of attitude\" toward adoption \nof \"tough measures\" against Pyongyang.  In particular, Pak said \nthat North Korea's pique was based on reports of the 17 March \n\"high-level strategic meeting\" in Seoul, which had reportedly \ndiscussed holding Team Spirit, the deployment of Patriot \nmissiles, and international sanctions.  Pak equated this alleged \nchange in the South's attitude to \"a grave crime\" and claimed \nthat it necessitated the reimposition of the four demands made \nearlier by the North--demands that Pak had previously admitted \nwere \"barriers\" to envoy exchanges erected by Pyongyang itself. \n(The North had demanded that the South refrain from 1) staging \nlarge-scale nuclear exercises, 2) introducing new weapons, \nincluding the Patriot missile, and 3) using threats of \ninternational sanctions.  The North had also demanded previously \nthat 4) the South retract ROK President Kim Yong-nam's remarks \nabout not shaking hands with North Korean officials.) \n\nDemand for Apology     Signaling that Pyongyang is no longer \ninterested in continuing dialogue with Seoul, Pak accused the \nSouth of having used the envoy exchange talks \"solely\" for the \npurpose of derailing DPRK-U.S. high-level talks.  He went on to \n\"strongly insist\" that the South \"frankly admit\" this \"dark \nintention\" and \"apologize before the nation.\"  Attempting to \nplace the onus of any breakdown of dialogue on the South, Pak \nfurther accused Seoul of having in effect adopted \"a declaration \nof abandonment of the special envoys exchange, a declaration of \nan all-out confrontation with us, and a declaration of war.\" \n\nPyongyang radio on 19 March depicted Pak as making his most \nprovocative remarks only in response to remarks the South made at \nthe 19 March session.  According to the radio, the South side had \nsaid that should the envoy exchange talks be discontinued, \"there \nis no knowing what danger would materialize.\"  To this Pak \nreportedly replied, \"Don't worry about it.  What do you think the \nSouth is?  If the North suffers damage, do you think the South \nwill go unscathed?\"  Pak went on to pledge unspecified \"immediate \nand decisive countermeasures of self-defense\" in case \"some \npowers impose sanctions on us or otherwise provoke us.\"  The \nradio said Pak coupled his pledge with a \"stern warning\" not to \ntake the North Korean threats lightly, quoting him as saying, \"we \ndo not know how to engage in idle talk. \"(SEE NOTE) \n\n(NOTE: Seoul's government-run KBS-1 television on 19 March \nbroadcast video recording of even more inflammatory remarks by \nPak that were captured by closed-circuit television coverage of \nthe meeting.  In the video, Pak told his Southern counterpart, \nSong Yong-tae, to \"give a careful consideration to the \nconsequences of a war,\" and warned that \"Seoul is not far from \nhere.  If war breaks out, it will turn into a sea of fire.  Mr. \nSong, it will probably difficult for you, too, to survive.\" \nPyongyang media have not been observed to report on this portion \nof Pak's remarks.) \n\nModeration of Threats     Pyongyang subsequently appeared to \nbackpedal a bit on its threats of war.  In a 21 March statement \nissued in the name of the North Korean delegation to the inter- \nKorean contacts, which again chastised the South for \"suddenly\" \nassuming what it described as a hardline stance, the North made \nonly passing references to the possibility of war, implying \ninstead that the downfall of the ROK government will come from \nrevolt within the South (Pyongyang radio, 21 March).  The \nstatement warned the ROK to realize that \"no dictators\" in the \nSouth had \"survived committing the antinational act of betraying \nfellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces\" and that \n\"these flunkeyist, nation-sellers have met a bitter end.\" \nNorth Korean Motives     Pyongyang may calculate that its \nbrinksmanship will sufficiently split opinions within the South \nKorean government to make a firm stand against the North \ndifficult.  For the past few months, Seoul media reporting on \nrelations with the North has indicated that there are serious \ndivisions within the Seoul government over how to deal with \nPyongyang.  The latest of these indications came shortly after a \n12 March inter-Korean meeting.  The Seoul daily Hanguk Ilbo on 13 \nMarch cited an unnamed ROK \"government official\" as saying that \nthe South and the United States \"believe\" that by failing to \nagree to the exchange of envoys with Seoul, Pyongyang had \n\"unilaterally invalidated\" an agreement reached with Washington \non resuming high-level talks in Geneva later in the month. \nApparently alarmed by the possible effects such remarks could \nhave on the inter-Korean talks, other \"government officials\" were \ncited the next day by the South Korean news agency Yonhap as \nadvocating a different approach (14 March).  One of them was \nquoted as saying that Seoul should not consider it \"a violation \nof the North Korea-U.S. agreement\" even if North Korea \"refused\" \nthe envoy exchange outright.  All that would happen, he \nreportedly said, would be that \"the date of the third round \n[U.S.-North Korea] meeting would be delayed\" until the envoy \nexchange was realized. \n\nIn addition, there has been intermittent South Korean reporting \nof a division of views between Seoul and Washington that could \nhave emboldened Pyongyang.  Most recently, for instance, Yonhap \non 16 March cited Kim Tae-chung, a \"retired\" opposition leader \nand former presidential candidate, as \"lashing out\" at U.S. \n\"hardliners\" for allegedly jeopardizing lives of Koreans in their \npursuit of confrontation with North Korea on the nuclear issue. \nSimilarly, in an article datelined Washington, the Seoul daily \nChoson Ilbo on 13 March claimed that the U.S. Congress has \nconcluded that differences between Washington and Seoul over how \nto deal with the North Korean nuclear issue are serving as a \n\"stumbling block\" in the U.S. Government's formulation of its \npolicy toward Pyongyang--reporting that could have encouraged \nPyongyang to reinforce its constant attempt to drive a wedge \nbetween Washington and Seoul. \n\nOutlook     Pyongyang media treatment of the 19 March meeting \nseems aimed at portraying the North Korean leadership as fully \nprepared to face the worst case scenario.

        "text": "\n\nThe     Japan Association of Defense Industry (JADI), existing in its \npresent form since 1988 and tracing its origin back to 1951, is an \nindustry association under the supervision of the Ministry of \nInternational Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Japan Defense Agency \n(JDA).  JADI promotes the development of Japanese defense technology \nand equipment, monitors foreign technology, lobbies on behalf of its \ncorporate members for government defense spending, and cooperates \nwith the government on export controls. \n\n   ASSOCIATION OVERVIEW \n\n   JADI (Nihon boei sobi kogyokai), an industry association (shadan \nhojin) of over 130 corporations, promotes the development of a \nstrong Japanese defense industry.  According to the latest edition \nof the annual guide to MITI's public corporations (TSUSHOSANGYOSHO \nKANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENAAN 1993 May 93), JADI seeks to \"work towards \nthe sound development of the defense equipment industry and, in so \ndoing, contribute to the establishment of Japan's defense base\" by \npromoting research and development of defense equipment and \nimproving production technology.  The association's stated \nactivities regarding defense equipment are as follows:  conducting \nsurveys and research; gathering and disseminating information, \nsupporting R&D; offering proposals on modernization, greater \nefficiency, and support for Japan's defense production base; hosting \nseminars; cooperating with other organizations related to the \ndefense industry; carrying out contract research, helping devise \nStandards; and cooperating with the government's export control \nPolicies.  Central to the association's activities is the promotion \nof R&D and Japan's independent development of defense technology and \n\nproduct ion capacity (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 3 Jun 87, NIKKEI SANGYO \nSHIMBUN 1O Jan 87). \n\n   CLOSE TIES TO GOVERNMENT \n\n   The association has existed at three different levels of \norganization, each successively closer to the government.  In \nOctober 1951, five steel companies led the way in establishing the \nJapan Technology Production Association (Nihon gijutsu seisan \nkyoryokukai), a private company (kabushiki kaisha).  In October \n1953, the organization changed its name to the Japan Weapons \nIndustry Association (Nihon heiki kogyokai) and became a voluntary \nassociation (nini dantai) (YOMIURI SHIMBUN 26 Sep 88). \n\n   In September 1988, the organization assumed its present name and \nstatus as an industry association under joint MITI and JDA \nadministration.  One month prior to the change, NIKKEI SANGYO \nSHIMBUN (4 Aug 88) reported that the organization had experienced \n\"difficulties\" as a voluntary organization in securing long-term \nloans and government subsidies.  YOMIURI SHIMBUN (26 Sep 88) \nreported that the organization would now receive government \nsubsidies due to its \"upgrading\" to the status of a legal entity \n(hojin). \n\n   Along with the Promotion in status came enhanced government \nsupervision.  Chairman Kosaku Inaba, president of Ishikawajima- \nHarima Heavy Industries (IHI), and the three vice chairmen, all \ncorporate executives, retained their positions.  But the insertion \nof three members of the government \"old boy\" network signalled \nJADI's closer ties to the government (ASAHI SHIMBUN 17 Sep 88, \nNIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 17 Sep 88, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 26 Sep 88). \nTomoyoshi Kabaya, a former MITI official who headed the JDA \nEquipment Bureau, assumed the newly created post of JADI director- \ngeneral.  Takeshi Moriyama, former chief of JDA's Central \nProcurement Office, assumed office under him as executive director. \nBoth Kabaya and Moriyama continue to hold those positions, according \nto the latest edition of TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENRAN \n1993 (May 93).  In contrast, IHI's Inaba and the three corporate \nexecutives under him vacated their seats after serving out their \ntwo-year terms. \n\n   JADI's chairmen and vice chairmen are drawn from the top ranks of \nJapan's defense industry.  Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy \nIndustries (MHI), has chaired JADI since June 1992 (NIKKEI SANGYO \nSHIMBUN 28 May 92).  IHI Vice President Kunio Minamizaki, Fujitsu \nVice President Kimio Otsuki, and Asahi Chemical Industry Chairman \nNobuo Yamaguchi are listed as the current vice chairmen \n(TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENRAN 1993 May 93).  The \nassociation's chairmen have been chosen from among Japan's top seven \ndefense companies:  MHI, Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), IHI, \nMitsubishi Electric, NEC, Toshiba, and Japan Steel Works (NIKKEI \nSANGYO SHIMBUN 12, 28 May 92).  Preceding Iida as JADI chairman were \nKHI President Hiroshi Oba (199O-92) and IHI President Kosaku Inaba \n(1988-9O).  The association's top post has also rotated among \ncompanies according to three categories of defense equipment: \nfirearms/special vehicles, ammunition/missiles, and electronics \n(NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 May 9O, ASAHI SHIMBUN 3O May 87, NIKKEI \nSANGYO SHIMBUN 2O Mar 85). \n\n   MONITORING U.S. TECHNOLOGY \n\n   The association has been monitoring U.S. defense technology as \npart of its mission to gather and disseminate information on foreign \ndevelopments.  For example, Washington and Tokyo reached an \nagreement in July 1987 for Japanese corporations to participate in \nthe U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).  JADI's predecessor \norganization joined the Keidanren's Defense Production Committee and \nthe Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) in a joint \nconference to learn the details of Japanese corporate partici- \npation in SDI research from MITI, the \"point of contact\" for \nJapanese companies interested in the project (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 4 \nAug 87).  The association was also to join SJAC and Keidanren's \nDefense Production Committee in an \"SDI Information Center\" slated \nto begin operations in early 1988.  The association would cooperate \nin gathering information, primarily open-source documents in the \nUnited States, on SDI-related technology (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 17 \nNov 87).  Moreover, at a New Year's party in January 1988, \nassociation chairman Kosaka Inaba and JDA Equipment Bureau Director- \nGeneral Masaji Yamamoto gave speeches on Japanese corporate \nparticipation in SDI, stressing that companies study the technology \ninvolved and maintain liaison with the Japanese Government (NIKKEI \nSANGYO SHIMBUN 9 Jan 88). \n\n   LOBBYING GOVERNMENT \n\n   JADI also lobbies government officials and politicians.  Chairman \nIida joined SJAC's chief and other representatives of defense- \nrelated organizations in an October 1993 \"round table discussion\" on \nthe Mid-Term Defense Plan (1991-95) with then-JDA Director-General \nKeisuke Nakanishi.  JADI joined the call for increased defense R&D \nsPending to sustain the employment and expertise of JaPanese \nresearchers and engineers in the field (ASAHI SHIMBUN 19 Oct 93). \nDuring the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) years in power (1955- \n93), JADI kePt channels of communication to the succession of JDA \nchiefs and LDP defense experts.  Among the guests at the \nassociation's annual New Year's party, for example, have been then- \nJDA Director-General Koichi Kato (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 10 Jan 86). \n\n   (AUTHOR:  MERCADO.
